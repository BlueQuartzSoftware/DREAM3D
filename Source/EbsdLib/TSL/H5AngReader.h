 * @brief
 *
 * @date Mar 24, 2011
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * TSL OIM Scans are stored in the HDF5 file into a heirarchy of folders where
 * each folder stores an individual .ang file. The folder has a simple index as
 * its name, for example if the index of the .ang file was 11 then the HDF folder
 * that contains that .ang file's data has an HDF Group name of "11". Within this
 * folder there are 2 more folders: <b>Data</b> and <b>Header</b>.\n
 *   The <b>Data</b> folder contains all the columner data from the .ang file where
 * each column is its own HDF data set. The <b>Header</b> folder contains the complete
 * header data from the .ang file as either data sets or as subfolders. The dataset
 * with the name <b>OriginalFile</b> contains the unchanged complete header from
 * the .ang file in a single string HDF data set. Each of the header keys has been
 * also saved to its own HDF data set which can be seen with any HDF5 data viewer
 * application. For the Phase data inside the header a new HDF group is created
 * called <b>Phases</b> which contains each of the phase data. Again each phase
 * has an HDF5 group where its data is collected with a simple numerical index
 * as its name. Within each Phase's HDF Group folder are the various data sets
 * that make up the Phase data. They are:
 * @li Phase
 * @li MaterialName
 * @li Formula
 * @li Info
 * @li Symmetry
 * @li LatticeConstants
 * @li NumberHKLFamilies
 *
 * The HKLFamilies form another sub hdf group within the Phase group. This folder
 * contains datasets where each data set holds a single HKLFamily from the Phase
 * data. The dataset is an HDF5 Compound Data Type where you have the following
 * layout
 * @code
 * typedef struct
{
    int h;
    int k;
    int l;
    int s1;
    float diffractionIntensity;
    int s2;
} HKLFamily_t;
 * @endcode
 *
 * After reading the HDF5 file one can use the various methods to extract the phases
 * or other header information or all the columnar data.
