  <h1>StatsGenerator</h1>
  <h2>Size Distribution Tab</h2>
  <img src="image001.png" alt="StatsGenerator Main Window">

<ol>
  <li><b>Mu</b>
  This is the average value of the lognormal grain size distribution</li>
  <li><b>Sigma</b>
  This is the standard deviation of the lognormal grain size distribution</li>
  <li><b>Sigma Cut Off Value</b>
  This allows the user to truncate the distribution to remove very large grains</li>
  <li><b>Bin Step Size</b>
  This is the size of bin to use in segregating the grains into size classes for
  correlating other statistics to grain size. Note that the Bins to be Created
  is displayed in the bottom left corner.</li>

  <li><b>Preset Statistic Models</b>
  This allows the user to select a ‘morphological-type’ of microstructure to
  populate the default data.
  <ol>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Default – this populates the statistic tabs with generic random
      data that may not create a ‘buildable’ microstructure. This option should
      only be used if the user is going to enter the values on all the
      statistics tabs themselves.</li>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Equiaxed – this populates the statistic tabs with data that is
      designed to generate a random equiaxed microstructure.</li>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Rolled – this populates the statistic tabs with data that is
      designed to generate a rolled microstructure with elongated grains with
      user defined aspect ratios.
    <ol>
      <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Aspect Ratio 1 – this is the
        aspect ratio between the dimensions of the grains in the rolling
        direction and transverse direction, respectively.</li>
      <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Aspect Ratio 2 – this is the
        aspect ratio between the dimensions of the grains in the rolling
        direction and normal direction, respectively. This value must be larger
        than Aspect Ratio 1 or the default values will be wrong.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><b>Phase Properties</b>
  this is the area where the user can enter information about the phase for
  which statistics are currently being generated. The Plus Button allows the
  user to add a phase, the Minus Button allows the user to remove a phase and
  the Wheel Button allows the user to edit the currently selected phase.
  
  <img src="image002.png" alt="Phase Properties">
 
  <ol>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Select Crystal Structure – this allows the user to specify the
      crystal structure of the phase. Currently, the two options are Cubic and
      Hexagonal.</li>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Fraction – this is the volume fraction of the phase. The Calculated
      Phase Fraction is updated as more phases are added, by scaling the current
      total of all the phases fractions to 1 (in case the user’s total is not
      equal to 1 when finished).</li>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Select Phase Type – this specifies the type of the phase.
      Currently, the two types of phases are Primary and Precipitate. Note that
      there must be at least one Primary phase before any Precipitate phase can
      be created or the Synthetic Builder will fail.</li>
    <li style="list-style: Upper-roman;">Fraction of Precipitate on Boundary – if the phase type is set to
      Precipitate, then the user must specify the number fraction of the
      precipitates that are located on grain boundaries of the primary phase.
      This value will be scaled to 1 if the user’s value is larger than 1. The
      value is keyed to -1 for Primary phases.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
  <li><b>Create Data</b>
  This locks in the values the user has entered and populates the other tabs
  with default values. The user can move through the other tabs and change any
  default values if desired.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Omega3 Tab</h2>
  <img src="image003.png" alt="Omega 3 GUI">
  <ol>
  <li>Bin – this column is calculated from the size distribution and
  cannot be changed.</li>
  <li>Alpha – this is the alpha parameter of a Beta distribution.
  Omega 3 is normalized and can only be between 0 and 1, so the Beta
  distribution is a good fit</li>
  <li>Beta – this is the beta parameter of the Beta distribution.</li>
  <li>Color – this allows the user to change colors of the curves for
  image creation or easier identification during stats generation</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Shape Distribution Tab</h2>
  <img src="image004.png" alt="Shape Distribution Function GUI">
  <ol>
<li>Bin – this column is calculated from the size distribution and
  cannot be changed.</li>
  <li> Alpha – this is the alpha parameter of a Beta distribution. B/A,
  C/A and C/B are normalized and can only be between 0 and 1, so the Beta
  distribution is a good fit</li>
  <li>Beta – this is the beta parameter of the Beta distribution.</li>
  <li>Color – this allows the user to change colors of the curves for
  image creation or easier identification during stats generation</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>Neighbor Distribution Tab</h2>
  <img src="image005.png" alt="Neighbor Distribution Function GUI">
  <ol>
  <li>Bin – this column is calculated from the size distribution and
  cannot be changed.</li>
  <li>Alpha – this is the alpha parameter of a Power Law distribution.</li>
  <li>K – this is the exponent of a Power Law Distribution</li>
  <li>Beta – this is the beta parameter of a Power Law distribution.</li>
  <li>Color – this allows the user to change colors of the curves for
  image creation or easier identification during stats generation</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>ODF Tab</h2>
  <img src="image006.png" alt="ODF GUI">
  <ol>
    <li><b>Weights and Spreads Sub-Tab</b>
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Euler 1-3 – these are the
          Euler angles that define an orientation that the user would like to
          increase in weight.</li>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Weight – this is the weight in
          MRD (multiples of random) to be assigned to the orientation listed</li>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Sigma – this is the spread to
          use in blurring out the orientation chosen. The value corresponds to
          the number of bins in Rodrigues (orientation) space it takes for the
          MRD value entered in the Weight column to reduce to 0.0 (decreasing
          quadratically from the bin of the entered orientation).</li>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Calculate ODF – this builds
          the ODF and then creates pole figures (PFs) for the user to inspect.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Pole Figure (PF) Sub-Tabs</b>
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">There are three PFs formed for
          each of the crystal structures that can be chosen (though they are of
          different directions for the different crystal structures).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  <li><b>MDF Sub Tab</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This sub-tab will display the baseline MDF for the generated ODF.  The
  implemented algorithm proceeds by randomly sampling pairs of orientations from
  the ODF and calculating the misorientation (axis-angle only).  Only the angle 
  is plotted in the misorientation distribution plot.  The user can also add 
  axis-angle pairs to increase in weight.<p></p>
  <img src="image007.png" alt="MDF GUI"><p></p>
  
  <ol>
  <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Angle – this is the angle of the misorientation to 
  increase in weight.</li>
  <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Axis – this is the axis of the misorientation to 
  increase in weight.  If the crystal structure being used for the phase is Hexagonal, 
  then this axis is in the 3-index, orthogonal convention, not the true (hkil) convention.</li>
  <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Weight – this is the weight in units of MRD 
  (multiples of random) of the entered misorientation.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
 </ol>


  <h2>Axis ODF Tab</h2>
  <img src="image008.png" alt="Axis ODF GUI">
  <ol>
    <li><b>Weights and Spreads Sub-Tab</b>
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">Euler 1-3 – these are the
          Euler angles that define an orientation that the user would like to

          use in blurring out the orientation chosen. The value corresponds to
          the number of bins in Rodrigues (orientation) space it takes for the
          MRD value entered in the Weight column to reduce to 0.0 (decreasing

    </li>
    <li><b>Pole Figure (PF) Sub-Tabs</b>
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style: lower-alpha;">There are three PFs formed, which correspond to the location of the 3 principal axes of the grains to be generated (i.e a > b > c).</li>
