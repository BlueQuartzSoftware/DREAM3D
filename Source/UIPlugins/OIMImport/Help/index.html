1.  <b>Input Directory</b> - Directory where the .ang files are located
<ol>
<li>  Total Ang Files Found - Code will determine how many .ang files are present.</li>
<li>  Currently only .ang files are supported.</li>
</ol>
2.  <B>Output File</b> - Name and location of desired output .h5ang file
3.  <b>Z spacing</b> - This is the spacing between sections
<ol>
<li>  Note that the x and y spacings are automatically read from the .ang files.</li>
<li>  If the x and y spacing values change, the ones in the first section are used.</li>
</ol>
4.  <b>File Prefix, Suf fix and File Extension</b> - Variables that are combined to generate the list of file names
<ol>
<li> These values should all be automatically determined, but should be checked if there are weird prefixes or suffixes.</li>
</ol>
5.  <b>Start Slice, End Slice and Total Digits</b> - More variables that are combined to generate the list of file names
<ol>
<li>  Start slice and end slice define the range of data to be included in the .h5ang file (i.e. you don’t have to import the entire dataset).</li>
<li> Total digits controls the number of leading zeros that are present in the filename.</li>
</ol>
6.  <b>File List</b> - This bank lists all the files that will be included in the .h5ang file based on the inputs chosen.  
<ol>
<li>  The files in the list will have a green light if they are present in the directory selected and a red light if they are not present.</li>
</ol>
