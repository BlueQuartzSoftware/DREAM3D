  <ol>
    <li><b> <i>  Input Directory</i></b> - Directory where the .ang files are located
  	<ul>
    	<li>a. <b> <i> Total Ang Files Found</i></b> - Code will determine how many .ang files are present. 
    	<li>b. Currently only .ang files are supported. 
  	</ul>
    <li><b> <i>  Output File</i></b> - Name and location of desired output .h5ang file 
    <li><b> <i>  Z spacing</i></b> - This is the spacing between sections 

  	<ul>
    	<li>a. Note that the x and y spacings are automatically read from the .ang files. 
    	<li>b. If the x and y spacing values change, the ones in the first section are used. 
  	</ul>  
    <li><b> <i>  File Prefix, Suffix and File Extension</i></b> - Variables that are combined to generate the list of file names 
  	<ul>
    	<li>a. These values should all be automatically determined, but should be checked if there are weird prefixes or suffixes. 
	</ul>
    <li><b> <i>  Start Slice, End Slice and Total Digits  </i> </b> More variables that are combined to generate the list of file names 
  	<ul>
    	<li>a. <li>Start slice and end slice define the range of data to be included in the .h5ang file (i.e. you don√ït have to import the entire dataset). 
    	<li>b. <li>Total digits controls the number of leading zeros that are present in the filename. 
	</ul>    
	<li><b> <i>  File List</i></b> - This bank lists all the files that will be included in the .h5ang file based on the inputs chosen.   
   <ul>
     <li>a. The files in the list will have a green light if they are present in the directory selected and a red light if they are not present. 
	</ul>
</ol>
