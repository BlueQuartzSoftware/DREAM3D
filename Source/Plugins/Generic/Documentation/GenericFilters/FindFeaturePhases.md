Find Feature Phases {#findfeaturephases}
==========
## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Misc)

## Description ##
This filter determines the phase of each **Feature** by querying the phase of the **Elements** that belong to the **Feature**.
Note that it is assumed that all **Elements** belonging to a **Feature** are of the same phase, and thus any **Element** can be used to determine the phase of the **Feature** that owns that **Element**.

## Parameters ##
None

## Required Geometry ##
Not Applicable

## Required Arrays ##
| Type | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions (dimension, size) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Element | CellPhases | Int | (1,1) | Specifies the phase of the **Element** |
| Cell | FeatureIds | Int | (1,1) | Specifies to which **Feature** each **Cell** belongs. |

## Created Arrays ##
| Type | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions (dimension, size) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Feature | FeaturePhases | Int | (1,1) | Specifies the phase of the **Feature** - Values will begin at 1 as there is no phase 0, which is used temporarily in some filters for bad data|
