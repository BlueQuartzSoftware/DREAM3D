# Find Surface Features  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Generic (Spatial)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines whether a **Feature** touches an outer surface of the sample. This is accomplished by simply querying the **Feature** owners of the **Cells** that sit at either . Any **Feature** that owns one of those **Cells** is said to touch an outer surface and all other **Features** are said to not touch an outer surface of the sample.


This **Filter** determines whether a **Feature** touches an outer _Surface_ of the sample volume. A **Feature** is considered touching the _Surface_ of the sample if either of the following conditions are met:

+ Any cell location is x<sub>min</sub>, x<sub>max</sub>, y<sub>min</sub>, y<sub>max</sub>, z<sub>min</sub> or z<sub>max</sub>
+ Any cell has **Feature ID = 0** as a neighbor.

The output of this filter is a **Feature** level array of booleans where 0=Interior/Not touching and 1=Surface/Touching.

*Note*: If there are voxels within the volume that have **Feature ID=0** then any feature touching those voxels will be considered a _Surface_ feature.

### 2D Image Geometry ###

If the structure/data is actually 2D, then the dimension that is planar is not considered and only the **Features** touching the edges are considered surface **Features**.


### Example Output ###
