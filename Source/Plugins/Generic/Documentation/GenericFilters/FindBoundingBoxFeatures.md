Find Biased Features (Bounding Box) 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Generic (Spatial)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines which **Features** are _biased_ by the outer surfaces of the sample. Larger **Features** are more likely to intersect the outer surfaces and thus it is not sufficient to only note which **Features** touch the outer surfaces of the sample. Denoting which **Features** are biased is important so that they may be excluded from any statistical analyses. The algorithm for determining whether a **Feature** is _biased_ is as follows: 

1. The _centroids_ of all **Features** are calculated
2. All **Features** are tested to determine if they touch an outer surface of the sample
3. The largest box is found that does not include any of the _centroids_ of **Features** that intersect an outer surface of the sample
4. Each **Feature**'s _centroid_ is checked to see whether it lies within the box.  

*If a **Feature**'s _centroid_ lies within the box, then the **Feature** is said to be _unbiased_, and if it lies outside the box, then the **Feature** is said to be _biased_.* 

By definition of the box, no **Feature** that intersects an outer surface of the sample can be considered _unbiased_, but it should be noted that **Features** that do not intersect the outer surfaces may still be considered _biased_. This algorithm works to determine the biased **Features** because all **Features** have one (and only one) centroid, no matter their size. Generally, this method will deem more small **Features** biased than the set of **Features** that just intersect the outer surfaces - and this corrects for the increased likelihood that larger **Features** will touch an outer surface.

*Note:* This **Filter** is a modification of an algorithm from Dave Rowenhorst (Naval Research Laboratory).
