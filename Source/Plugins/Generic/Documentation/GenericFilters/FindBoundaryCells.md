Find Boundary Cells {#findboundarycells}
=============
## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Spatial)

## Description ##
This Filter determines, for each **Cell**, the number of neighboring **Cells** that are owned by a different **Feature**.  The algorithm for determining this is as follows: 

1. Identify the **Feature** to which a **Cell** belongs
2. Identify the **Features** to which each of the current **Cell**'s six (6) face-face neighboring **Cells** (front, back, left, right, up, down) belong
3. Determine the number of those neighboring **Cells** belonging to a different **Feature** than the current **Cell**. 
4. Repeat 1-3 for all **Cells**

## Parameters ##
None

## Required Geometry ##
Image / Rectilinear Grid

## Required Arrays ##
| Type | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions (dimension, size) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | FeatureIds | Int | (1,1) | Specifies to which **Feature** each **Cell** belongs. |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions (dimension, size) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | SurfaceCells | Int | (1,1) | The number of neighboring **Cells** of a given **Cell** that belong to a different **Feature** than itself. Values will range from *0* to *6* |
