Find Boundary Cells {#findboundarycells}
=============
## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Spatial)

## Description ##
This Filter determines, for each **Cell**, the number of neighboring **Cells** that are owned by a different **Feature**.  The algorithm for determining this is as follows: 

1. Identify the **Feature** to which a **Cell** belongs
2. Identify the **Features** to which each of the current **Cell**'s six (6) face-face neighboring **Cells** (front, back, left, right, up, down) belong
3. Determine the number of those neighboring **Cells** belonging to a different **Feature** than the current **Cell**. 
4. Repeat 1-3 for all **Cells**

## Parameters ##
None

## Required Geometry ##
Image / Rectilinear Grid

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | FeatureIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Feature** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Segment Features (Misorientation, C-Axis Misorientation, Scalar) (Reconstruction), Read Dx File (IO), Read Ph File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Cell | SurfaceCells | Value (int) equal to the number of neighboring **Cells** of a given **Cell** that belong to a different **Feature** than itself. Values will range from *0* to *6* |  |
