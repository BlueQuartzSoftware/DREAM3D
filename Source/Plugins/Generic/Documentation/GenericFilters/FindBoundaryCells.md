Find Boundary Cells (Image) 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Generic (Spatial)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines, for each **Cell**, the number of neighboring **Cells** that are owned by a different **Feature**.  The algorithm for determining this is as follows: 

1. Identify the **Feature** to which a **Cell** belongs
2. Identify the **Features** to which each of the current **Cell**'s six (6) face-face neighboring **Cells** (front, back, left, right, up, down) belong
3. Determine the number of those neighboring **Cells** belonging to a different **Feature** than the current **Cell**. 
4. Repeat 1-3 for all **Cells**

## Parameters ##

| Name             | Type | Description |
|------------------|------|-------------|
| Ignore Feature 0 | bool | Do not use feature 0 |

## Required Geometry ##

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cell Attribute Array** | FeatureIds | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Feature** each **Cell** belongs. |

## Created Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cell Attribute Array** | BoundaryCells | int32_t | (1) | The number of neighboring **Cells** of a given **Cell** that belong to a different **Feature** than itself. Values will range from *0* to *6* |

## Example Pipelines ##
