# EM/MPM  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Reconstruction (Segmentation)

## Description ##

This **Filter** performs the EM/MPM segmentation algorithm on an **Attribute Array** representing a grayscale image. The EM/MPM algorithm employs an advanced expectation maximization routine over Gaussian mixtures to determine an image segmeneation into a defined number of classes. The segmented image will be stored into a new **Attribute Array** with a user definable name. Note that the created segmentation will have **Cell** labels defining the class membership.  Thus, the labels will be unsigned 8 bit integers, matching the incoming grayscale image.  These labels can be considered **Feature** Ids for the purposes of most DREAM.3D analysis routines.  However, DREAM.3D assumes that **Feature** Ids are signed 32 bit integers.  It may therefore be required to use the [Convert Attribute Data Type](ConvertData.html "") **Filter** to convert the segmented image labels from unsigned 8 bit integers to signed 32 bit integers for further analysis.  

**It is highly recommended that users consult references [1], [2], [3], and [4] for details on the impact of particular parameters on the EM/MPM algorithm.**
