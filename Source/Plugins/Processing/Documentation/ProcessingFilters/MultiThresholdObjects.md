Multi Threshold Objects {#multithresholdobjects}

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Threshold)

## Description ##
This filter allows the user to input single or multiple criteria for thresholding **Objects** in an **Attribute Matrix**. Internally the algorithm creates the output boolean arrays for each comparison that the user creates. Then all the output arrays are compared and if __any__ of the values for a specific **Object** is __false__ then the corresponding **Object** in the final output array is marked as false. This is considered a logical 'or' operation.
An example of this filter's use would be after EBSD data is read into DREAM3D and the user wants to have DREAM3D consider **Cells** that the user considers 'good'. The user would insert this filter and select the criteria that makes a **Cell** 'good'. All arrays **must** come from the same **AttributeMatrix** in order for the filter to execute. For example, an integer array contains the values 1,2,3,4,5. For a comparison value of 3 and the comparison operator greater than, the boolean threshold array produced will contain false, false, false, true, true.
