Smooth Bad Data (Coordination Number) 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Processing (Cleanup)

## Description ##

This **Filter** smoothes the interface between *good* and *bad* data. The user can specify a *coordination number*, which is the number of neighboring **Cells** of opposite type (i.e., *good* or *bad*) compared to a given **Cell** that is acceptable.  For example, a single *bad* **Cell** surrounded by *good* **Cells** would have a *coordination number* of *6*.  The number entered by the user is actually the maximum tolerated *coordination number*.  If the user entered a value of *4*, then all *good* **Cells** with 5 or more *bad* neighbors and *bad* **Cells** with 5 or more *good* neighbors would be removed.  After **Cells** with unacceptable *coordination number* are removed, then the neighboring **Cells** are *coarsened* to fill the removed **Cells**.  

By default, the **Filter** will only perform a single iteration and will not concern itself with the possibility that after one iteration, **Cells** that were acceptable may become unacceptable by the original *coordination number* criteria due to the small changes to the structure during the *coarsening*.  The user can opt to enable the _Loop Until Gone_ parameter, which will continue to run until no **Cells** fail the original criteria.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Coordination Number | int32_t | Number of neighboring **Cells** that can be of opposite classification before a **Cell** will be removed |
| Loop Until Gone | bool | Whether to run a single iteration or iterate until no *bad* **Cells** have more than the above number of *good* neighbor **Cells** |
