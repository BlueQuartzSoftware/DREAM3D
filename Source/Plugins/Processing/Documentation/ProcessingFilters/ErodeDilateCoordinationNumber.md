Smooth Bad Data (coordination Number) {#erodedilatecoordinationnumber}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Cleanup)

## Description ##
This filter smoothes the interface between "good" and "bad" data. The user can specify a *coordination number* that is the number of neighboring **Cells** of opposite type (i.e. "good" or "bad") compared to a given **Cell** that is acceptable.  For example a single "bad" **Cell** surrounded by "good" **Cells** would have a *coordination number* of *6*.  The number entered by the user is actually the maximum tolerated *coordination number*.  If the user entered a value of *4*, then all "good" **Cells** with 5 or more "bad" neighbors and "bad" **Cells** with 5 or more "good" neighbors would be removed.  After **Cells** with unacceptable *coordination number* are removed, then the neighboring **Cells** are *coarsened* to fill the removed **Cells**.  

By default, the filter will only perform a single iteration and will not concern itself with the possibility that after one iteration, **Cells** that were acceptable may become unacceptable by the original *coordination number* criteria due to the small changes to the structure during the *coarsening*.  The user can opt to enable the "Loop Until Gone" parameter, which will continue to run until no **Cells** fail the original criteria.

## Parameters ##
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| Coordination Number | Integer | Number of neighboring **Cells** that can be of opposite classification before a **Cell** will be removed |
| Loop Until Gone | Boolean (On or Off) | Tells filter whether to run a single iteration or iterate until no "bad" **Cells" have more than the above number of "good" neighbor **Cells** |

## Required Geometry ##
