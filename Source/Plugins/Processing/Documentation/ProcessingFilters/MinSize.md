Minimum Size Filter (All Phases) {#minsize}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Cleanup)

## Description ##
This filter removes **Features** that have a total number of **Cells** below the minimum threshold defined by the user. Entering a number larger than the largest **Feature** generates an _error_ (since all **Features** would be removed). Hence, a choice of threshold should be carefully be chosen if it is not known how many **Cells** are in the largest **Features**. After removing all the small **Features**, the remaining **Features** are isotropically coarsened to fill the gaps left by the small **Features**.
The filter can be run in a mode where the minimum number of neighbors is applied to a single ensemble.  The user can select to apply the minimum to one ensemble and specify which ensemble that is.

## Parameters ##
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Minimum Allowed **Feature** Size | Int | Number of **Cells** that must be present in the **Feature** for it to remain in the sample |
| Apply to Single Phase | Boolean | Tells the filter whether to apply minimum to single ensemble or all ensembles |
| Phase Number to Run Min Size Filter on | Int | Tells filter which ensemble to apply minimum to (if apply to single phase is set to true) |

## Required Geometry ##
Image/Rectilinear Grid

| Feature | NumCells | Int | (1) | Specifies the number of **Cells* each **Feature** has |
| Feature | FeaturePhases | Int | (1) | Specifies the **Ensemble** of the **Feature** - only required if Apply to Single Phase is true  |
