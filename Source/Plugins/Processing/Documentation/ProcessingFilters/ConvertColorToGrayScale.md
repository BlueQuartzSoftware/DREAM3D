Color to GrayScale {#convertcolortograyscale}

## Description ##

This **Filter** allows the user to select a *flattening* method for turning an array of RGB or RGBa values into grayscale values.

+ Luminosity: The **luminosity** method is a more sophisticated version of the average method. It also averages the values, but it forms a weighted average to account for human perception. Weâ€™re more sensitive to green than other colors, so green is weighted most heavily. The default formula for luminosity is BT709 Greyscale: Red: 0.2125 Green: 0.7154 Blue: 0.0721. The user can set the weightings to what ever values they would like.
+ Average  (R + G + B) / 3
+ Lightness (max(R, G, B) + min(R, G, B)) / 2
+ Color Channel: The user selects a specific R|G|B channel to use as the GrayScale values.

The user can select 1 or more image data arrays which are assumed to be multi-component arrays of unsigned 8 bit values. The user can create a new AttributeMatrix if they want to store all the newly created arrays in a separate AttributeMatrix.

### Additional GrayScale Conversions ###

The following are some additional accepted grayscale conversions

+ RMY Greyscale: Red: 0.5 Green: 0.419 Blue: 0.081
+ (YIQ/NTSC): Red: 0.299 Green: 0.587 Blue: 0.114


## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| Flattening Method | Enumeration | Which method to use when flattening the RGB array |
| Luminosity Triplet | 3xFloats | Only used if Luminosity is selected as conversion method |
| Color Channel | 1 Int | Only needed if the Color Channel conversion method is selected |
| Output Array Prefix | String | This prefix will be added to each array name that is selected for conversion to form the new array name |
