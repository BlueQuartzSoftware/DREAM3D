Remove Flagged Features {#removeflaggedfeatures}
=====

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Cleanup)

## Description ##
This filter will remove **Features** that have been flagged by another filter from the structure.  The filter requires that the user point to a boolean array at the **Feature** level that tells the filter whether the **Feature** should remain in the structure.  If the boolean array is *false* for a **Feature**, then all **Cells** that belong to that **Feature** are temporarily *unassigned* and after all *undesired* **Features** are removed, the remaining **Features** are isotropically coarsened to fill in the gaps left by the removed **Features**.

## Parameters ##
None

## Required Geometry ##
Image/Rectilinear Grid

| Feature | None | Boolean | (1) | Specifies whether the **Feature** will remain in the structure or not (ie "true" = remain and "false" = remove) |
