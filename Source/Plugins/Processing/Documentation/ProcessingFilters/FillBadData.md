# Fill Bad Data  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Processing (Cleanup)

## Description ##

This **Filter** removes small *noise* in the data, but keeps larger regions that are possibly **Features**, e.g., pores or defects. This **Filter** collects the *bad* **Cells** (*Feature Id = 0*) and _erodes_ them until none remain. However, contiguous groups of *bad* **Cells** that have at least as many **Cells** as the minimum allowed defect size enter by the user will not be _eroded_.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Decision |
|------|------|------|
| Minimum Allowed Defect Size | int32_t | The size at which a group of *bad* **Cells** are left unfilled as a "defect" |
| Replace Bad Data | bool | Whether to replace all data or just *Feature Ids* |
| Store Defects as New Phase | bool | Whether to change the phase of "defects" larger than the minimum allowed size above |
