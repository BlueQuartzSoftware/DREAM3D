# Find Projected Image Statistics  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Processing (Image)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates statistics (minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation and variance) for each *stack* of **Cells** perpendicular to a user selected plane of interest (XY, XZ, YZ).  Each **Cell** in the *stack* is then assigned the statistic(s) for the whole stack. For example, if there was a 100x200x300 **Cell** volume and the plane of interest was selected as *XY*, then a 100x200 temporary *image* would be created.  Each **Cell** in the temporary *image* would represent a 300 **Cell** *stack* in the Z direction.  The statistics listed previously would be calculated for each 300 **Cell** *stack* and stored at the corresponding **Cell** in the 100x200 temporary *image*.  Finally, the values for each of the statistics stored in the temp *image* are assigned to all 300 **Cells** in the *stack* that they describe, which is equivalent to "extruding" the 100x200 temporary *image* 300 *Cells** in the Z direction.
