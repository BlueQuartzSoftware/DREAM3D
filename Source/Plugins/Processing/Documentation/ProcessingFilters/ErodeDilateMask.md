Erode/Dilate Mask {#erodedilatemask}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Cleanup)

## Description ##
If the mask is _dilated_, the filter grows the "true" regions by one **Cell** in an iterative sequence for a user defined number of iterations.  During the *dilate* process the classification of any **Cell** neighboring a "false" Cell** will be changed to "true".  
If the mask is _eroded_, the filter shrinks the "true" regions by one **Cell** in an iterative sequence for a user defined number of iterations.  During the *erode* process the classification of the "false" **Cells** is changed to "true" if one of its neighbors is "true".
The filter also offers the option(s) to turn on/off the erosion or dilation in specific directions (x, y or z).

## Parameters ##

## Required Geometry ##
Image/Rectilinear Grid

## Required Arrays ##
| Type | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions (dimension, size) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | GoodVoxels | Boolean | (1,1) | Used to define **Cells** as "good" or "bad"  |
