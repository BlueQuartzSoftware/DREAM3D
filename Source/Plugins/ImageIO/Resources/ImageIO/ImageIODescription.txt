<h3>ImageIO  Plugin</h3>

<p>This plugin implements filters to import and write out images from/to stanard image file format types such as Tif, PNG, BMP or GIF. The plugin also contains a few specialized filters that can import a stack of images but interpret the stack as a multi-component data array. More information can be found in the respective filter's documentation.
The filters use the Image IO functionality of QImage. Because of this supporting 16 bit images is not possible.</p>
