Write Dx File (Feature Ids) 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

IO (Output)

## Description ##

This **Filter** writes the selected **Featuer Ids** to a Dx file. The file format is that used by the _OpenDX Source Software_ based on IBM's [Visualization Data Explorer](http://www.opendx.org). **Note that the data is written according to the OpenDX specifications where the Z dimension is moving the fastest, then Y, then X.**

This filter will _ONLY_ write the feature Ids and is NOT a full fledged OpenDX convertor.

### Example Output ###

The .dx file:
```
    # object 1 are the regular positions. The grid is 118 202 190. The origin is
    # at [0 0 0], and the deltas are 1 in the first and third dimensions, and
    # 2 in the second dimension
    #

	object 1 class gridpositions counts 118 202 190
	origin 0 0 0
	delta  1 0 0
	delta  0 1 0
	delta  0 0 1
    #

    # object 2 are the regular connections
    #

	object 2 class gridconnections counts 118 202 190
    #

    # object 3 are the data, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with
    # the positions ("dep" on positions). The positions increment in the order
    # "last index varies fastest", i.e. (x0, y0, z0), (x0, y0, z1), (x0, y0, z2),
    # (x0, y1, z0), etc.
    #

	object 3 class array type int rank 0 items 4444713 data follows
	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
	   ..
```
The .dx file with a surface layer:
```
	object 1 class gridpositions counts 120 204 192
	origin 0 0 0
	delta  1 0 0
	delta  0 1 0
	delta  0 0 1
    #

    # object 2 are the regular connections
    #

	object 2 class gridconnections counts 120 204 192
    #

    # object 3 are the data, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with
    # the positions ("dep" on positions). The positions increment in the order
    # "last index varies fastest", i.e. (x0, y0, z0), (x0, y0, z1), (x0, y0, z2),
    # (x0, y1, z0), etc.
    #

	object 3 class array type int rank 0 items 4613987 data follows
