# Read STL File  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

IO (Input)

## Description ##

This **Filter**  will read a binary STL File and create a **Triangle Geometry** object in memory. The STL reader is very strict to the STL specification. An explanation of the STL file format can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL). The structure of the file is as follows:

	UINT8[80]     Header
	UINT32     Number of triangles

	foreach triangle
	REAL32[3]     Normal vector
	REAL32[3]     Vertex 1
	REAL32[3]     Vertex 2
	REAL32[3]     Vertex 3
	UINT16     Attribute byte count
	end

**It is very important that the "Attribute byte Count" is correct as DREAM.3D follows the specification strictly.** If you are writing an STL file be sure that the value for the "Attribute byte count" is _zero_ (0). If you chose to encode additional data into a section after each triangle then be sure that the "Attribute byte count" is set correctly. DREAM.3D will obey the value located in the "Attribute byte count".
