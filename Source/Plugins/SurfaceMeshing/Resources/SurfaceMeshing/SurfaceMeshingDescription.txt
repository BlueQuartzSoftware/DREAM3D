<h3>SurfaceMeshing Plugin</h3>

<p>This plugin contains filters that implement various algorithms that can produce a traditional surface mesh made up of triangles and only represent the interface between features. A few smoothing algorithms are also implemented (Laplacian). Some various statistics about the generated mesh can also be calculated.</p>
