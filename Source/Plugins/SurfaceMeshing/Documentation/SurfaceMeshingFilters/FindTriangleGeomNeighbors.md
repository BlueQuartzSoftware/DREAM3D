# Find Feature Neighbors from Triangle Geometry  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines the list of neighboring (surface sharing) **Features** of each **Feature** in a **Triangle Geometry**.  The result is the number of neighbors (and the list of neighbors) of each surface meshed **Feature**.  The neighbors are determined using the following algorithm:

1. Triangulate each face of the polyhedron (in this case, each face is already a triangle within the **Triangle Geometry**)
2. For each triangular face, query the *Face Labels* array to note the **Features** on either side of the triangle face
3. For each **Feature** on either side of the triangle face, add the other **Feature** to the list of neighbors
4. Count the number of unique features in each **Features** neighbor list

## Parameters ##

None

## Required Geometry ##

Triangle
