Reverse Triangle Winding {#reversetrianglewinding}
============

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Surface Meshing (Connectivity/Arrangement)

## Description ##
This **Filter** reverses the _winding_ for each **Triangle** in a **Triangle Geometry**. This will _reverse_ the direction of calculated **Triangle** normals. Some analysis routines require the normals to be pointing "away" from the center of a **Feature**. This **Filter** allows for manipulation of this construct.

## Parameters ##
None

## Required Geometry ##
Triangle

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |

| **Data Container** | None | N/A | N/A | **Data Container** that holds the **Triangle Geometry** to reverse winding |

## Created Objects ##
