# Find Feature Shapes from Triangle Geometry  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the second-order moments of each enclosed **Feature** in a **Triangle Geometry**.  The second-order moments allow for the determination of the *principal axis lengths, pricipal axis directions, aspect ratios and moment invariant Omega3s*.  The *principal axis lengths* are those of a "best-fit" ellipsoid.  The algorithm for determining the moments and these values is as follows:

1. For each **Triangle** on the bounding surface of a **Feature**, construct a tetrahedron whose fourth vertex is the centroid of the **Feature**, ensuring normals are consistent (this **Filter** uses the convetion where normals point inwards; note that the actual winding of the **Triangle Geometry** is not modified)
2. Subdivide each constructed tetrahedron into 8 smaller tetrahedra
3. For each subdivided tetrahedron, compute the distance from that tetrahedron's centroid to the centroid of the parent **Feature**
4. For each subdivided tetrahedron, calculate Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Ixz and Iyz using the x, y and z distances determined in step 1
5. Use the relationship of *principal moments* to the *principal axis lengths* for an ellipsoid, which can be found in [4], to determine the *Axis Lengths*
6. Calculate the *Aspect Ratios* from the *Axis Lengths* found in step 5.
7. Determine the Euler angles required to represent the *principal axis directions* in the *sample reference frame* and store them as the **Feature**'s *Axis Euler Angles*.
8. Calculate the moment invariant Omega3 as definied in [2] and is discussed further in [1] and [3] 

*Note:* Due to the method used to subdivide the tetrahedra, some sharp corners of shapes may not be properly represented, resulting in inaccurate Omega3 values.  This problem is especially apparent for perfect rectangular prisms, but any shape with clear sharp corners may be affected.
