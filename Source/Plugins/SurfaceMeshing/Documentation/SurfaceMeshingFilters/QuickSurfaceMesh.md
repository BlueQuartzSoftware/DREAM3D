Quick Surface Mesh {#quicksurfacemesh}
============

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Surface Meshing (Generation)

## Description ##
This **Filter** generates a **Triangle Geometry** from a grid **Geometry** (either an **Image Geometry** or a **RectGrid Geometry**) that represents a surface mesh of the present **Features**. The algorithm proceeds by creating a pair of **Triangles** for each face of the **Cell** where the neighboring **Cells** have a different **Feature** Id value. The meshing operation is extremely quick but can result in a surface mesh that is very "stair stepped". The user is encouraged to use a [smoothing operation](@ref laplaciansmoothing) to reduce this "blockiness".

The user may choose any number of **Cell Attribute Arrays** to transfer to the created **Triangle Geometry**. The **Faces** will gain the values of the **Cells** from which they were created.  Currently, the **Filter** disallows the transferring of data that has a *multi-dimensional* component dimensions vector.  For example, scalar values and vector values are allowed to be transferred, but N x M matrices cannot currently be transferred.
