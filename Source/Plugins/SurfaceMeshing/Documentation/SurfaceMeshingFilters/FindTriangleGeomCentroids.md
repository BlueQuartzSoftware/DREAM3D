# Find Feature Centroids from Triangle Geometry  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines the centroids of each **Feature** in a **Triangle Geometry**.  The centroids are determined using the following algorithm:

1. Query each triangle within the **Triangle Geometry** to determine its two owners
2. Add the 3 nodes of that triangle to the set of nodes bounding those two owners (*Note that a set will only allow each node to be entered once for a given owner*)
3. For each **Feature**, find the average (x,y,z) coordinate from the set of nodes that bound it

## Parameters ##

None

## Required Geometry ##

Triangle
