# Generate Geometry Connectivity  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Surface Meshing (Connectivity/Arrangement)

## Description ##

This **Filter** will generate the following connectivity data structures:

+ _Per Vertex Element List_: For each **Vertex** in the **Geometry**, a list of triangles to which the **Vertex** belongs

+ _Per Element Neighbors List_: For each primary unit **Element** in the **Geometry**, a list of **Elements** that share a common edge. If the mesh is non-manifold, each **Element** may have more than neighbors than **Edges**

Note that the resulting lists are stored with the **Geometry** object itself, not as separate **Attribute Arrays**. Some **Geometries**, such as a **Vertex Geometry**, may not have implemented the necessary connectivity functions, and will trigger an error when running the **Filter**.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------| ----------- |
| Generate Per Vertex Element List | bool | Whether to generate the per vertex element list |
| Generate Element Neighbors List | bool | Whether to generate the element neighbors list |

## Required Geometry ##

Any

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Data Container** | None | N/A | N/A | **Data Container** that holds the **Geometry** for which to generate the connectivity |

## Created Objects ##

The resulting connectivity lists are stored with the **Geometry** objects, _not_ in any separate **Attribute Arrays**.
