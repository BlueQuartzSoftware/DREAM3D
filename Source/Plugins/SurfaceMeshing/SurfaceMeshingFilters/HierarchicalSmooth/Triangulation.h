 * Triangulation.h -- contains a simple implementation of the
 * 'triangulation' object from Matlab. Modeled from the Python
 * prototype written by Siddharth Maddali. Customized for use
 * in hierarchical smooth and doesn't have the full range of
 * applicability as its Matlab counterpart. In particular,
 * there is no functionality to computer mesh node-related
 * quantities like local face and node normals. This will be
 * added later as needed.
