 * @class GenerateNodeTriangleConnectivity GenerateNodeTriangleConnectivity.h /SurfaceMeshFilters/GenerateNodeTriangleConnectivity.h
 * @brief This filter creates a pair of arrays that help to describe the connectivity in a triangle
 * based surface mesh. The two arrays are:
 * @li UniqueEdges Array - This is a 2 component array where each component is a vertex id and the pair of
 * vertex ids make up the Edge Id (64 bit unique value). The index into the array that the pair occurs is
 * used internally in other referencing arrays but pairs are guaranteed to be unique.
 * @li TriangleEdges Array - This array is a 3 component array where the values of each component is the index
 * into the UniqueEdges array. Since each triangle can only have 3 Edges.
