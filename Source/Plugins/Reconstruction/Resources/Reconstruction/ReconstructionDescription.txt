<h3>Reconstruction Plugin</h3>

<p>This plugin contains filters that can help reconstruct a 3D data set that is built up from slices of data. These data sets can come from serial sectioning experiments or other experiments that generate a set of 2D data that are differentiated by an offset in the Z Axis (typically). Both alignment and segmentation filters are included in this plugin</p>
