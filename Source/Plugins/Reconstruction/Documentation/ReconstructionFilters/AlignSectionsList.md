Align Sections (List) {#alignsectionslist}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Reconstruction (Alignment)

## Description ##
This **Filter** accepts a .txt file that has full **Cells** shifts that have already been calculated in it.  

The format of the file is as follows:

    slice_number xshift yshift
    slice_number xshift yshift
    slice_number xshift yshift
    etc...

The slices must be ordered from the bottom of the sample to the top of the sample (i.e., the first line of shifts should be the second slice relative to the first, then the next line is the third slice relative to the second, and so on). Also, the file must be either space or tab delimited.

*Note:* Some of the other alignment **Filters** have the option to write out a .txt file with their calculated shifts in it. If the user would like to use one of these files then the input parameter "DREAM.3D Alignment File" can be turned on to indicate that the file came from one of these filters.

| DREAM.3D Alignment File | Bool | Turn this ON if the alignment file was generated by another DREAM.3D Alignment filter |
