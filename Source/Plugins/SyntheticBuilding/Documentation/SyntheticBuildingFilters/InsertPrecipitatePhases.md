Insert Precipitate Phases {#insertprecipitatephases}
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Synthetic Building (Packing)

## Description ##
If there are precipitate _Phase Types_ in the volume, then this **Filter** will place precipitate **Features** with the sizes, shapes, physical orientations and locations corresponding to the goal statistics. Precipitate **Features** are currently placed _one at a time_ and are _not allowed to overlap_. The precpitiate packing process is similar to that for [packing primary phases](@ref packprimaryphases).

Currently, the parameters that are matched to target parameters include: 

<ul>
<li>Fraction of precipitates on a grain boundary</li>
<li>Size distribution of the precipitates</li>
<li>Volume fraction of precipitates</li>
<li>Omega 3 distribution of precipitates in each size bin</li>
<li>b/a size distribution of precipitates in each size bin </li>
<li>c/a size distribution of precipitates in each size bin </li>
<li>Axis orientation distribution </li>
<li>Normalized radial distribution function (if opted for by the user) </li>
</ul>

Note that for an ellipsoid a > b > c.

The user can specify if they want *periodic boundary conditions*.  If they choose *periodic boundary conditions*, when the precipitate **Features** are being placed, if a **Feature** attempts to extend past the boundary of the volume it wraps to the opposing face and is placed on the opposite side of the volume.

The user can also specify if they want to write out the goal attributes of the generated precipitate **Features**.  The **Features**, once packed, will not necessarily have the exact statistics (size, shape, orientation, number of neighbors) as sampled from the distributions.  This is due to the use of non-space-filling objects in the packing process.  The overlaps and gaps that occur after packing, must be assigned and will cause the **Features** to deviate from the intended goal (albeit hopefully in a minor way).  Writing out the goal attributes allows the user to then calculate the actual attributes and compare to determine how well the packing algorithm is working for their **Features**.

The user can also choose to read in a list of precipitate **Features** with their locations and size and shape descriptions already determined. If this option is choosen, the **Filter** will skip the steps of generating the **Features** and iteratively placing them and will begin *growing* the **Features** defined in list.  The format of the *Feature Input File* is:


	Number of Features
	Phase X Y Z A B C O3 Phi1 PHI Phi2
	Phase X Y Z A B C O3 Phi1 PHI Phi2
	Phase X Y Z A B C O3 Phi1 PHI Phi2
	.
	.
	.
	Phase X Y Z A B C O3 Phi1 PHI Phi2


where (X, Y, Z) are the coordinates of the **Feature's** centroid, (A, B, C) are the major, mid and minor principal semiaxis lengths of the **Feature**, O3 is the Omega 3 value of the **Feature** and (Phi1, PHI, Phi2) are the *Euler angles* that describe the **Features**'s orientation in the sample reference frame.
