Establish Matrix Phase 
=============

Synthetic Building (Packing)

## Description ##

This **Filter** inserts matrix phase(s) into a synthetic volume. A _matrix_ phase can be considered a contiguous region within a volume. The algorithm for inserting matrix phase(s) is as follows:

1. Identify all the matrix phases from the **Ensemble** *Phase Types* array
2. Determine the relative volume fractions of the matrix phases (i.e., if there are two matrix phases and they have volume fractions of *0.2* and *0.3*, respectively, then they would be scaled to *0.4* and *0.6* to total *1*) 
3. Identify all **Cells** that are not currently assigned to a **Feature** (i.e., belong to **Feature** *0*).
4. For each "unassigned" **Cell**, generate a random number to decide which matrix phase the **Cell** will be assigned to.  

The **Filter** requires the user to select a **Cell Attribute Matrix** in which to place the generated **Cell** level **Attribute Arrays**. This **Attribute Matrix** is most likely generated when [initializing the synthetic volume](@ref initializesyntheticvolume). The **Filter** will also create a new **Cell Feature Attribute Matrix** and **Cell Ensemble Attribute Matrix** to correspond to the instantiated **Features** and **Ensembles** in the **Image Geometry**.

*Note:* The **Filter** _does not_ actually try to match the volume fractions of the matrix phases, but rather just uses the relative volume fractions to decide what fraction of the "unassigned" **Cells** get assigned to each matrix phase.  If the fraction of unassigned  **Cells** is smaller or larger than the total volume fractions of the matrix phases, then the absolute volume fractions of the matrix phases will not match the goal defined in the _Statistics_ array.
