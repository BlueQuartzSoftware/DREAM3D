Match Crystallography 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Synthetic Building (Crystallography)

## Description ##

This **Filter** attempts to match a defined _orientation distribution function_ (ODF) to a set of **Features**. The matching algorithm involves two processes that are performed iteratively:

1. _Swappping_ out the orientation of a randomly selected **Feature** for a new orientation sampled from the goal ODF
2. _Switching_ the orientations of two **Features** selected at random 

The _switch_ or _swap_ is accepted if it lowers the error of the current ODF and misorientation distribution function (MDF) from the goal. This process continues for a user defined number of iterations, or until the texture functions are matched to within precision.
