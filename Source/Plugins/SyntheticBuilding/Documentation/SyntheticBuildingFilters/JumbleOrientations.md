Jumble Orientations 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Synthetic Building (Crystallography)

## Description ##

This **Filter** "jumbles" the orientations of a set of **Features** amongst each other. The algorithm for this procedure is as follows:

1. For each **Feauture**, select another random **Feature** belonging to the same **Ensemble**
2. Swap the orientations at both the **Feature** and **Element** level of the current **Feature** and the randomly selected **Feature**
3. After iterating through all **Features**, recompute the average orientations for each **Feature**

By cycling through all the **Features**, it is guaranteed that each **Feature** will be swapped at least once, but it may be swapped multiple times if a later **Feature** randomly selects it to swap with.
