Insert Atoms

## Description ##

This **Filter** creates a **Vertex** geometry where the **Vertices** represent atom positions.  The **Filter** requires a **Triangle** surface mesh that bounds **Features** of different crystallographic orientation.  The **Filter** then extracts the **Triangles** associated with each **Feature** and in parallel inserts atoms on the crystal lattice of each **Feature**.  The steps associated with inserting the atoms in each **Feature** are as follows:

1. Transform the coordinates of the **Triangles** into the reference frame of the **Feature's** crystallographic orientation using its stored orientation
2. Determine the minimum and maximum X, Y and Z coordinate of the transformed **Triangles**
3. Generate a grid of points starting at the minimum (X,Y,Z) coordinate using the lattice constants entered (with a||x, b||y and c||z) until reaching the maximum (X,Y,Z) coordinate. Add points at the proper positions given the crystal basis choosen by the user 
4. Transform list of points generated in 3 into the original **Triangle** reference frame using the inverse of the **Feature**'s crystallographic orientation
5. Check whether each point in the list falls inside of the n-sided polyhedron defined by the **Triangles** that bound the **Feature**.  Remove the point from the list if it falls outside of the **Feature**'s bounds. Assign the **Feature**'s number to the point if it does fall inside of the **Feature**

After all **Features** have had atoms inserted, combine the point lists for all the **Features**.

*Note:* Since each **Feature** is treated independently (in parallel), the interface between neighboring **Features** may not be "in equilibrium".  For example, at one point along the interface, each of the neighboring **Features** may have an atom fall just slightly outside its bounds.  In this case, there may not be an atom on the "ideal" lattice for both **Features**, but maybe there should be a single atom that sits at the midpoint between the two ideal positions.  The algorithm will instead just omit any atom from that area.
