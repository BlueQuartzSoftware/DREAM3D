Add Orientation Noise 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Synthetic Building (Crystallography)

## Description ##

This **Filter** adds "noise" to the orientations on each **Element** of a **Geometry**.  This **Filter**  is intended to add "realism" to synthetic structures that have single orientations assigned to **Features**.  The user can specify a magnitude of the noise, which refers to the maximum rotation angle that is applied to the existing **Element** orientations.  The algorithm for applying the orientation noise is as follows:

1. Obtain the orientation of the **Element**
2. Generate a random number between *0* and the user defined magnitude. This value is the rotation angle
3. Generate a random unit vector.  This is the rotation axis
4. Calculate the rotation corresponding to the axis-angle pair generated in steps 2-3 and apply it to the orientation of the **Element** to obtain a new orientation
5. Repeat for all **Elements**
