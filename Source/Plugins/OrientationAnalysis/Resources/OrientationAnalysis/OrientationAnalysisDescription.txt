<h3>Orientation Analysis Plugin</h3>

<p>This plugin implements many filters that deal with Orientation in the context of materials science and crystallography. The filters can calculate statistics about crystal orientations, rotate reference frames, convert between many of the accepted forms of Orientation representations, generate color maps based on orientations, and read from EDAX and Oxford Instruments EBSD files. This plugin requires the sub-library <b>OrientationLib</b>. Please consult the complete list of filters contained in this plugin and the individual filter's documentation for more information.</p>
