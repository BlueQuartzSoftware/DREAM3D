Find Feature Neighbor Misorientations {#findmisorientations}
==========

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
This **Filter** determines, for each **Feature**, the misorientations with each of the **Features** that are in contact with it.  The misorientations are stored as a list (for each **Feature**) of angles (in degrees).  The axis of the misorientation is not stored by this **Filter**.

The user can also calculate the average misorientation between the feature and all contacting features.

### Notes ###

__NOTE:__ Only features with identical crystal structures will be calculated. If two features have different crystal structures then a value of NaN is set for the misorientation.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Find Average Misorientation Per Feature | bool | Specifies if the *average* of the misorienations with the neighboring **Features** should be stored for each **Feature** |

## Required Geometry ##
Not Applicable

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |

| **Feature Attribute Array** | NeighborLists | List of int32_t | (1) | List of the contiguous neighboring **Features** for a given **Feature** |
| **Feature Attribute Array** | AvgQuats | float | (4) | Defines the average orientation of the **Feature** in quaternion representation |
| **Feature Attribute Array** | Phases | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Ensemble** each **Feature** belongs |
| **Ensemble Attribute Array** | CrystalStructures | uint32_t | (1) | Enumeration representing the crystal structure for each **Ensemble** |
