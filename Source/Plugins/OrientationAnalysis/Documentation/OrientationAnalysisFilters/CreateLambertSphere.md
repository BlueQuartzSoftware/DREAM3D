Create Lambert Sphere from MasterPattern{#createlambertsphere}
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Surface Meshing (Processing)

## Description ##

This filter will generate a 3D Unit sphere from an EMsoft Master Pattern image where the master pattern is represented in a Lambert Square. In praticality any image can be used as long as the image is Square and a single plane.

The algorithm uses equations (8) & (9) from the paper D. Rosca, "New uniform grids on the sphere" Astronomy & Astrophysics, 520, A63 (2010) [http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2010/12/aa15278-10.pdf](http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2010/12/aa15278-10.pdf)

![Input master pattern image from EMsoft package.](images/MasterPattern_Lambert.png)

![Input master pattern as a stereographic projection.](images/Master_Stereographic.png)

![Output Norther Sphere as generated by the filter](images/LambertSphere.png)

The algorithm proceeds to create a vertex at the corner of every pixel in the image and a quad cell type for every pixel. The original pixel grayscale value is then assigned to that quad. The resulting Quad mesh is an equal area mesh.
