Find Feature Reference C-Axis Misalignments 
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the misorientation angle between the C-axis of each **Cell** within a **Feature** and the average C-axis for that **Feature** and stores that value for each **Cell**.  The average and standard deviation of those values for all **Cells** belonging to the same **Feature** is also stored for each **Feature**.

## Parameters ##

None

## Required Geometry ##

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cell Attribute Array** | FeatureIds | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Feature** each **Cell** belongs |
| **Cell Attribute Array** | Quats | float | (4) | Specifies the orientation of the **Cell** in quaternion representation |
| **Cell Attribute Array**     | Phases            | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Ensemble** each **Cell** belongs |
| **Feature Attribute Array** | AvgCAxes | float | (3) | The direction <u,v,w> of the **Feature's** C-axis in the sample reference frame |

## Created Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cell Attribute Array** | FeatureReferenceCAxisMisorientations | float | (1) | Misorientation angle (in degrees) between **Cell's** C-axis and the C-axis of the **Feature** that owns that **Cell** |
| **Feature Attribute Array** | FeatureAvgCAxisMisorientations | float | (1) | Average of the *FeatureReferenceCAxisMisorientation* values for all of the **Cells** that belong to the **Feature** |
| **Feature Attribute Array** | FeatureStdevCAxisMisorientations | float | (1) | Standard deviation of the *FeatureReferenceCAxisMisorientation* values for all of the **Cells** that belong to the **Feature** |
