Find Kernel Average Misorientations 
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines the Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) for each **Cell**.  The user can select the size of the kernel to be used in the calculation.  The kernel size entered by the user is the *radius* of the kernel (i.e., entering values of *1*, *2*, *3* will result in a kernel that is *3*, *5*, and *7* **Cells** in size in the X, Y and Z directions, respectively).  The algorithm for determination of KAM is as follows:

1. Calculate the misorientation angle between each **Cell** in a kernel and the central **Cell** of the kernel
2. Average all of the misorientations for the kernel and store at the central **Cell**

*Note:* All **Cells** in the kernel are weighted equally during the averaging, though they are not equidistant from the central **Cell**.

## Parameters ##
