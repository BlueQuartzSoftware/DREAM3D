# Find C-Axis Locations  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines the direction <u,v,w> of the C-axis for each **Element** by applying the quaternion of the **Element** to the <001> direction, which is the C-axis for *Hexagonal* materials.  This will tell where the C-axis of the **Element** sits in the *sample reference frame*.

*Note:* This **Filter** will only work properly for *Hexagonal* materials.  The **Filter** does not apply any symmetry operators because there is only one c-axis (<001>) in *Hexagonal* materials and thus all symmetry operators will leave the c-axis in the same position in the sample *reference frame*.  However, in *Cubic* materials, for example, the {100} family of directions are all equivalent and the <001> direction will change location in the *sample reference frame* when symmetry operators are applied.
