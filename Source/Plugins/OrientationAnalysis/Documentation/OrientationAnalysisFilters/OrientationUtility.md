OrientationAnalysis (Utilities)

## Description ##

This **Filter** is a **Utility** that allows the user to compute alternate representations of an orientation based on a another representation. The supported representations are:

+ Euler Angles
+ Axis Angle
+ Cubochoric
+ Homochoric
+ Orientation Matrix
+ Quaternion
+ Rodrigues

To use the utility, simply drag the filter into the pipeline area and start entering values for a representation. The other representations will be instantly calculated as shown in figure 1 below. **The Axis-Angle and Rodrigues vectors are automatically normalized for the user.**

![Figure 1: Orientation Utility where the user has entered an Axis-Angle representation.](Images/OrientationUtility_1.png)


If the user enters invalid values for a representation, an error message will be displayed and all input fields will be marked with the **NaN** symbol as show in figure 2 below.
