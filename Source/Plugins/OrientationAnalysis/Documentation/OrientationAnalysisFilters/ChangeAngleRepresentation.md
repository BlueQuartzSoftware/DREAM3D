# Convert Angles to Degrees or Radians  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Orientation Analysis (Conversion)

## Description ##

This **Filter** will multiply the values of every **Element** by a factor to convert *degrees to radians* or *radians to degrees*.  The user needs to know the units of their data in order to use this **Filter** properly. 

### Example Usage ###

2D data files that are in *HKL*'s .ctf format use degrees. 3D data files in *HKL*'s .ctf format use radians. All files in *TSL*'s .ang format use radians. If other file types are used, determine the units before running this **Filter**.
 
Generally, all **Filters** within DREAM.3D use radians as a default unit, but **Filters** may be added that require the Euler angles to be in degrees and this **Filter** will allow the user to move back-and-forth between the units.

If the wrong conversion is selected (e.g., the user chooses *degrees to radians*, but their data is already in radians), the **Filter** will apply the conversion anyway and will result in erroneous data being used for the rest of the pipeline. If unsure about the units, check with the software supplier.
