# Find Neighbor Slip Transmission Metrics  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates a suite of *slip transmission metrics* that are related to the alignment of slip directions and planes across **Feature** boundaries.  The algorithm for calculation of these metrics is as follows:

1. Get the average orientation of the **Feature**
2. Get the **Feature**'s list of neighboring **Features**
3. Get the average orientation of each neighboring **Feature**
4. Calculate metrics given by equations in *slip transmission metrics*
5. Store metrics in lists for the **Feature**
6. Repeat for all **Features**

*Note:* The transmission metrics are calculated using the average orientations for neighboring **Features** and not the local orientation near the boundary. Also, the metrics are calculated twice (i.e., when **Feature** 1 has neighbor **Feature** 2 and when **Feature** 2 has neighbor **Feature** 1) because the direction across the boundary between the **Features** affects the value of the metric.
