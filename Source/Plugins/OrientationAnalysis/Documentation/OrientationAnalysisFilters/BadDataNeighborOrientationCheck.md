Neighbor Orientation Comparison (Bad Data) 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Orientation Analysis (Cleanup)

## Description ##

This **Filter** compares the orientations of *bad* **Cells** with their neighbor **Cells**.  If the misorientation is below a user defined tolerance for a user defined number of neighbor **Cells** , then the *bad* **Cell** will be changed to a *good* **Cell**.

*Note:* Only the boolean value defining the **Cell** as *good* or *bad* is changed, not the data at **Cell**.

*Note:* The **Filter** will iteratively reduce the required number of neighbors from 6 until it reaches the user defined number. So, if the user selects a required number of neighbors of 4, then the **Filter** will run with a required number of neighbors of 6, then 5, then 4 before finishing.  

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Misorientation Tolerance (Degrees) | float | Angular tolerance used to compare with neighboring **Cells** |
| Required Number of Neighbors | int32_t | Minimum number of neighbor **Cells** that must have orientations within above tolerace to allow **Cell** to be changed |
