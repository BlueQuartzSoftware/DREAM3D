# Find Average C-Axis Orientations  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines the average C-axis location of each **Feature** by the following algorithm:

1. Gather all **Elements** that belong to the **Feature**
2. Determine the location of the c-axis in the sample *reference frame* for the rotated quaternions for all **Elements**
3.  Average the locations and store as the average for the **Feature**

*Note:* This **Filter** will only work properly for *Hexagonal* materials.  The **Filter** does not apply any symmetry operators because there is only one c-axis (<001>) in *Hexagonal* materials and thus all symmetry operators will leave the c-axis in the same position in the sample *reference frame*.  However, in *Cubic* materials, for example, the {100} family of directions are all equivalent and the <001> direction will change location in the sample *reference frame* when symmetry operators are applied.
