# Find Schmid Factors  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the Schmid factor of each **Feature** given its average orientation and a user defined loading axis. The Schmid Factor is the combination of the component of the axial force _F_ that lies parallel to the slip direction and the component that lies perpendicular to the slip plane.  The equation for the Schmid Factor is given as:

Schmid Factor = (cos &phi; cos &lambda;)

*The angle &phi; is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip plane normal, and &lambda; is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction in the slip plane.*
 
The **Filter** determines the Schmid factor for each **Feature** by using the above equation for all possible slip systems (given the **Feature's** crystal structure).  The largest Schmid factor from all of the slip systems is stored for the **Feature**. Only the Schmid factor is used in determining which slip system's Schmid factor to report.  The critical resolved shear stress for the different slip systems is not considered. 

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------| ----------- |
| Loading Direction | float (3x) | The loading axis for the sample |
| Store Angle Components of Schmid Factor | bool | Whether to store the &phi; and &lambda; for each **Feature** |
| Override Default Slip System | bool | Allows the user to manually input the slip plane and slip direction |
| Slip Plane | float (3x) | Vector defining the slip plane normal. Only needed if _Override Default Slip System_ is checked |
| Slip Direction | float (3x) | Vector defining the slip direction. Only needed if _Override Default Slip System_ is checked |
