## Description ##

This **Filter** will read a single .ctf file into a new **Data Container** with a corresponding **Image Geometry**, allowing the immediate use of **Filters** on the data instead of having to generate the intermediate .h5ebsd file. A **Cell Attribute Matrix** and **Ensemble Attribute Matrix** will also be created to hold the imported EBSD information. Currently, the user has no control over the names of the created **Attribute Arrays**. The user should be aware that simply reading the file then performing operations that are dependent on the proper crystallographic and sample reference frame will be **undefined, inaccurate and/or wrong**. In order to bring the [crystal reference frame](@ref rotateeulerrefframe) and [sample reference frame](@ref rotatesamplerefframe) into coincidence, rotations will need to be applied to the data. An excellant reference for this is the following PDF file:
[http://pajarito.materials.cmu.edu/rollett/27750/L17-EBSD-analysis-31Mar16.pdf](http://pajarito.materials.cmu.edu/rollett/27750/L17-EBSD-analysis-31Mar16.pdf)

### Default HKL Transformations ###

If the data has come from a HKL acquisition system and the settings of the acquisition software were in the default modes, then the following reference frame transformations need to be performed:

+ Sample Reference Frame: 180<sup>o</sup> about the <010> Axis
+ Crystal Reference Frame: None

The user also may want to assign un-indexed pixels to be ignored by flagging them as "bad". The [Threshold Objects](@ref multithresholdobjects) **Filter** can be used to define this _mask_ by thresholding on values such as _Error_ = 0.


### Radians and Degrees ###

2D .ctf files have their angles in **degrees**. Please be sure to [convert](@ref changeanglerepresentation) the Euler angles from degrees to radians before running any other **Filter**.


### The Axis Alignment Issue for Hexagonal Symmetry [1] ###

+ The issue with hexagonal materials is the alignment of the Cartesian coordinate system used for calculations with the crystal coordinate system (the Bravais lattice).
+ In one convention (e.g. EDAX.TSL), the x-axis, i.e. [1,0,0], is aligned with the crystal a1 axis, i.e. the [2,-1,-1,0] direction. In this case, the y-axis is aligned with the [0,1,-1,0] direction. (Green Axis in Figure 1)
+ In the other convention, (e.g. Oxford Instr, Univ. Metz software), the x-axis, i.e. [1,0,0], is aligned with the crystal [1,0,-1,0] direction. In this case, the y-axis is aligned with the [-1,2,-1,0] direction. (Red Axis in Figure 1)
+ This is important because texture analysis can lead to an ambiguity as to the alignment of [2,-1,-1,0] versus [1,0,-1,0], with apparent **30°** shifts in the data.
+ Caution: it appears that the axis alignment is a choice that must be made when installing TSL software so determination of which convention is in use must be made on a case-by-case basis. It is fixed to the y-convention in the HKL software.
+ The main clue that something is wrong in a conversion is that either the 2110 & 1010 pole figures are transposed, or that a peak in the inverse pole figure that should be present at 2110 has shifted over to 1010.
+ DREAM.3D uses the TSL/EDAX convention.
+ **The result of this is that the filter will _AUTOMATICALLY_ add 30° to phi2 when reading Oxford Instr (.ctf) files. There is no way to turn off this behavior. **
