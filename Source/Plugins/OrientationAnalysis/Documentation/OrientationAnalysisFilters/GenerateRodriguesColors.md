| X Reference Direction | Double |
| Y Reference Direction | Double |
| Z Reference Direction | Double |


## Required DataContainers ##

Voxel DataContainer

## Required Objects ##

| Type | Default Name | Description  | Filters Known to Create Data |
|------|--------------|------------|-----|
| Cell | CellEulerAngles |  These are the angles used to determine the colors | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Match Crystallography (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Cell | CellPhases |  These are used to determine which ensemble the **Cell** belongs to | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures |  These are the symmetries of the ensembles, which dictate orientation operations and which color palatte is used | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |

## Created Objects ##

| Type | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Cell | IPFColors | The RGB colors are encoded as an unsigned char triplet  |
