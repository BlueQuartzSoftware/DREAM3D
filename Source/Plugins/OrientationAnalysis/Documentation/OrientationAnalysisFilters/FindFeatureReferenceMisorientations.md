Find Feature Reference Misorientations 
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Crystallographic)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the misorientation angle between each **Cell** within a **Feature** and a *reference orientation* for that **Feature**.  The user can choose the *reference orientation* to be used for the **Features** from a drop-down menu.  The options for the *reference orientation* are the average orientation of the **Feature** or the orientation of the **Cell** that is furthest from the *boundary* of the **Feature**.

Note: the average orientation of the **Feature** is a typical choice, but if the **Feature** has undergone plastic deformation and the amount of lattice rotation developed is of interest, then it may be more reasonable to use the orientation *near the center* of the **Feature** as it may not have rotated and thus serve as a better *reference orientation*.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------| ----------- |
| Reference Orientation | Enumeration | Specifies the *reference orientation* to use when comparing to each **Cell** |

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cell Attribute Array** | FeatureIds | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Feature** each **Cell** belongs |
| **Cell Attribute Array**     | Phases            | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Ensemble** each **Cell** belongs |
| **Cell Attribute Array** | Quats | float | (4) | Specifies the orientation of the **Cell** in quaternion representation |
| **Feature Attribute Array** | AvgQuats | float | (4) | Specifies the average orientation of the **Feature** in quaternion representation  (<x,y,z>, w). Only required if the *reference orientation* is selected to be the average of the **Feature** |
| **Cell Attribute Array** | GBEuclideanDistances | float | (1) | Distance the **Cells** are from the *boundary* of the **Feature** they belong to. Only required if the *reference orientation* is selected to be the orientation at the **Feature** centroid  |
| **Ensemble Attribute Array** | CrystalStructures | uint32_t | (1) | Enumeration representing the crystal structure for each **Ensemble** |

## Created Objects ##
