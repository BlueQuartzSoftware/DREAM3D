# Generate Face Schuh Misorientation Coloring  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

SurfaceMesh (Misc)

## Description ##

This filter generates a 3 component vector per **Face** that is the axis-angle of the misorientation associated with the **Features** that lie on either side of the **Face**.  The axis is normalized, so if the magnitude of the vector is viewed, it will be the *misorientation angle* in degrees.


## Parameters ##

## Required DataContainers ##

SurfaceMesh - Valid Surface Mesh containing the shared vertex array and face list


## Required Objects ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Face | SurfaceMeshFaceLabels | N x 2 Col of signed integer |  | Quick Surface Mesh (SurfaceMeshing), M3C Surface Meshing (Slice at a Time) |

|------|------|---------|
| Face | SurfaceMeshTriangleIPFColors | N X 3 Array of floats that is the axis-angle of the misorientation across each **Face** |
