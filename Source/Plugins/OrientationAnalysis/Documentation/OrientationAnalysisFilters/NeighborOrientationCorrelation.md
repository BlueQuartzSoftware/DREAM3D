Neighbor Orientation Correlation {#neighbororientationcorrelation}

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Cleanup)

## Description ##
This filter first identifies all **Cells** that have a *confidence index* below the minimum set by the user.  Then, for each of those **Cells**, their neighboring **Cells** are checked to determine the number of neighbor **Cells** with orientations different than the reference **Cell** by more than the user defined *misorientation tolerance*.  In addition the neighboring **Cells** are compared with each other to determine the number of neighboring **Cells** that have the same orientation (again within the user defined tolerance). 
The *Cleanup Level* set by the user is then used to determine which **Cells** are replaced.  If a level of 5 is set, then at least 5 of the neighboring **Cells** must be different than the reference **Cell** and at least 5 of the neighboring **Cells** must be the same as each other (and so on for other *Cleanup Level*). 
If a **Cell** meets the replacement criteria, then all of its attributes are replaced with the attribtues of one of the neighboring **Cells** that are the same as each other.

*Note:* the filter will iteratively reduce the *Cleanup Level* from 6 until it reaches the user defined number. So, if the user selects a level of 4, then the filter will run with a level of 6, then 5, then 4 before finishing.
