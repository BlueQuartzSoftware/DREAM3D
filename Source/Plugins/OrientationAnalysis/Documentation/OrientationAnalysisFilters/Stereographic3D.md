OrientationAnalysis (Conversion Filters)

## Description ##

This **Filter** takes a set of quaternions as input and projects them into a 3D unit-radius ball using an equal-angle projection, i.e., a stereographic projection.  This is a convenient and intuitive way to represent in 3D the quaternion unit hemisphere, which lives embedded in a 4D space, in the same way that a standard 2D stereographic projection represents data lying on the surface of a 2D spherical surface embedded in a 3D space.  The filter generates a set of 3D stereographic coordinates, all of which have a modules less than or equal to 1.  Starting from the quaternion *q*, with scalar part *w*, the filter computes the stereographic vectors, **s**, according to the following relation:

**Note that if the value of w equals -1.0 then the filter will exit early and present an error. This is because with a value of -1 the output value would divide by zero.  This should not happen if the angle    falls inside the proper range.**


### Data Layout Notes ###

DREAM.3D orders a quaternion as ( < x, y, z >, w)>. If you are importing quaternions from another source, please ensure that the quaternions are in the correct order.
