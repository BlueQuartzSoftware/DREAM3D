## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the distance of each **Cell** from the nearest **Feature** boundary, **triple line** and/or **quadruple point**.  The following algorithm explains the process:

1. Find the **Feature** that owns each **Cell** and its six face-face neighbors of each **Cell**
2. For all **Cells** that have *at least 2* different neighbors, set their *GBEuclideanDistance* to *0*.  For all **Cells** that have *at least 3* different neighbors, set their *TJEuclideanDistance* to *0*.  For all **Cells** that have *at least 4* different neighbors, set their *QPEuclideanDistance* to *0*
3. For each of the three *EuclideanDistace* maps, iteratively "grow" out from the **Cells** identified to have a distance of *0* by the following sub-steps:

  - Determine the **Cells** that neighbor a **Cell** of distance *0* in the current map.
  - Assign a distance of *1* to those **Cells** and list the *0* **Cell** neighbor as their *nearest neighbor*
  - Repeat previous two sub-steps, increasing the distances by *1* each iteration, until no **Cells** remain without a distance and *nearest neighbor* assigned.

	*Note:* the distances calculated at this point are "city-block" distances and not "shortest distance" distances.

4. If the option *Calculate Manhattan Distance* is *false*, then the "city-block" distances are overwritten with the *Euclidean Distance* from the **Cell** to its *nearest neighbor* **Cell** and stored in a *float* array instead of an *integer* array.
