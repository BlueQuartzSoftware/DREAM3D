Find Feature Neighborhoods 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines the number of **Features**, for each **Feature**, whose *centroids* lie within a distance equal to a user defined multiple of the average *Equivalent Sphere Diameter* (*average of all **Features**).  The algorithm for determining the number of **Features** is given below:

1. Define a sphere centered at the **Feature**'s *centroid* and with radius equal to the average equivalent sphere diameter multiplied by the user defined multiple
2. Check every other **Feature**'s *centroid* to see if it lies within the sphere and keep count and list of those that satisfy
3. Repeat 1. & 2. for all **Features**

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------| ----------- |
| Multiples of Average Diameter | float | Defines the search radius to use when looking for "neighboring" **Features** |
