Find Feature Average Orientations {#findavgorientations}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics Filters (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
This Filter determines the average orientation of each **Feature** by the following algorithm:

1. Gather all **Elements** that belong to the **Feature**
2. Using the symmetry operators of the phase of the **Feature**, rotate the quaternion of the **Feature**'s first **Element** into the *Fundamental Zone* nearest to the origin.
3. Rotate each subsequent **Elements**'s quaternion (with same symmetry operators) looking for the quaternion closest to the quaternion selected in Step 2.
4. Average the rotated quaternions for all **Elements** and store as the average for the **Feature**

Note: The process of finding the nearest quaternion in Step 3 is to account for the periodicity of orientation space, which would cause problems in the averaging if all quaternions were forced to be rotated into the same *Fundamental Zone*

Note: The quaternions can be averaged with a simple average because the quaternion space is not distorted like Euler space.
