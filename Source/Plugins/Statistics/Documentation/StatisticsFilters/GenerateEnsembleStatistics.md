# Generate Ensemble Statistics  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Ensemble)

## Description ##

This **Filter** will fit "common" statistical distributions (as chosen by the user) to specific **Feature** level attributes.  The user can choose which types of attributes to fit (morphological and/or crystallographic) and what distribution to use when fitting them.  The parameters that define the "best-fit" distributions will be stored in an **Ensemble** array.  The **Ensemble** array will be an array of *Statistics Objects* that are defined structures within DREAM.3D.  The *Statistics Objects* are used when building synthetic structures in DREAM.3D.  There are other **Filters** for fitting a distribution to an individual array, but this **Filter** is intended to be used to populate the *Statistics Objects* needed to build synthetic structures. 

*Note:* The user must select a *Phase Type* for each **Ensemble** for which *Statistics Objects* are desired.  This selection occurs in the *Phase Types* selection, where the user must select the **Ensemble Attribute Matrix** that will be used to define the desired target **Ensembles**. The choice of *Phase Type* for each **Ensemble** will change the arrays that are fit for that **Ensemble**.

For more information on using this **Filter** to feed into synthetic building, visit the [tutorial](@ref tutorialsyntheticsingle).
