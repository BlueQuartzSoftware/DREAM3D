Find Feature Boundary Element Fractions 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the fraction of **Elements** of each **Feature** that are on the "surface" of that **Feature**.  The **Filter** simply iterates through all **Elements** asking for the **Feature** that owns them and if the **Element** is a "surface" **Element**.  Each **Feature** counts the total number of **Elements** it owns and the number of those **Elements** that are "surface" **Elements**.  The fraction is then stored for each **Feature**.

## Parameters ##

None

## Required Geometry ##

Not Applicable

## Required Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Element Attribute Array** | FeatureIds | int32_t | (1) | Specifies to which **Feature** each **Element** belongs |
| **Element Attribute Array** | BoundaryCells | int32_t | (1) | The number of neighboring **Elements** of a given **Element** that belong to a different **Feature** than itself |

## Created Objects ##

| Kind | Default Name | Type | Component Dimensions | Description |
|------|--------------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Feature Attribute Array** | SurfaceElementFractions | float | (1) | Fraction of **Elements** belonging to the **Feature** that are "surface" **Elements** |
