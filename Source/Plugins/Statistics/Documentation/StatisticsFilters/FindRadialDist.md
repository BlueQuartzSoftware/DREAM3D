Find Feature Radial Distribution Function 
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics Filters (Morphological)

## Description ##

This Filter determines the number of **Features** whose *centroids* lie within a distance of one *Equivalent Sphere Diameter* from a each **Feature**.  The algorithm for determining the number of **Features** is given below:

1. Find the *centroid* of a **Feature**.
2. Define a sphere centered at the the **Feature**'s *centroid*  and with radius equal to the **Feature**'s *Equivalent Sphere Diameter*.
3. Check every other **Feature**'s centroid to see if it lies within the sphere and keep count of those that satisfy.
4. Repeat 1-3 for all **Features**.
