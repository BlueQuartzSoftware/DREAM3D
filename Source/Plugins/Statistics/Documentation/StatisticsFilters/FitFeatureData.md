Fit Distribution to Feature Data 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics (Ensemble)

## Description ##

This **Filter** will fit "common" statistical distributions (as chosen by the user) to specific **Feature** level attributes.  The user can chose both which attributes to fit and with what distribution to fit them.  The parameters that define the "best-fit" distributions will be stored in an **Ensemble** array.  The user also has the option to remove *biased* **Features** from the fitting process.

*Note:* The array selected must be a scalar array

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------| ----------- |
| Distribution Type | Enumeration | Specifies distribution type to fit to the data (options include lognormal, power and beta distributions) |
| Remove Biased Features | Boolean | Whether biased features are to be omitted from the binning counts |
