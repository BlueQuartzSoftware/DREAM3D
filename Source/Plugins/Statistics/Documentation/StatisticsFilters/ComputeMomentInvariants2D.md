## Description ##

This **Filter** computes the 2D Omega-1 and Omega 2 values from the _Central Moments_ matrix and optionally will normalize the values to a unit circle and also optionally save the _Central Moments_ matrix as a DataArray to the *Cell Feature Attribute Matrix*. Based off the paper by MacSleyne et. al [1], the algorithm will calculate the 2D central moments for each feature starting at *feature id = 1*. Because *feature id 0* is of special significance and typically is a matrix or background it is ignored in this filter. If any feature id has a Z Delta of > 1, the feature will be skipped. This algorithm works strictly in the XY plane and is meant to be applied to a 2D image. Using the research from the cited paper certain shapes can be detected using the Omega-1 and Omega-2 values. An example usage is finding elliptical shapes in an image:


See below figure from [1] that can help the user classify objects.
