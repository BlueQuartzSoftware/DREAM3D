# Sample Triangle Geometry at Specified Points  #

Sampling (Resolution)

## Description ##

This **Filter** "samples" a triangulated surface mesh with a specified list of **Vertices** (or points) read from a file.  The sampling is performed by the following steps:

1. Determine the bounding box and **Triangle** list of each **Feature** by scanning all **Triangles** and noting the **Features** on either side of the **Triangle**
2. For each **Vertex** read from the file, determine which bounding box(es) they fall in (*Note:* the bounding box of multiple **Features** can overlap)
3. For each bounding box a **Vertex** falls in, check against that **Feature's** **Triangle** list to determine if the **Vertex** falls within that n-sided polyhedra (*Note:* if the surface mesh is conformal, then each **Vertex** will only belong to one **Feature**, but if not, the last **Feature** the **Vertex** is found to fall inside of will *own* the **Vertex**)
4. Assign the **Feature** number that the **Vertex** falls within to the *Feature Ids* array in the new **Vertex** geometry

The **Filter** will write out a file with the list of **Feature** Ids for the **Vertices**.  The **Filter** also creates a new **Data Container** (named _SpecifiedPoints_) to hold the **Vertex** geometry, a **Vertex Attribute Matrix** (named _SpecifiedPointsData_) in that **Data Container** and the **Feature** Ids that live on each **Vertex**.  The user does not currently have control over the names of these created entities.
