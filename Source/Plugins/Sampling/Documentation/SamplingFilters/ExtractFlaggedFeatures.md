Extract Flagged Features (Rogues Gallery) 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Sampling (Cropping/Cutting)

## Description ##

This **Filter**, using a boolean array identifying **Features** to be *extracted*, crops out the smallest bounding box around each **Feature** of interest.  First, the **Filter** determines the bounding box ((xMin-xMax), (yMin-yMax), (zMin-zMax)) for each **Feature**.  Then, the **Filter** checks to see if the **Feature** has been "flagged" for extraction.  If the **Feature** is to be extracted, the bounding box is used to define a volume for cropping.  The cropped volume for each extracted **Feature** is stored as a new **Data Container**.  The cropped volumes will have their origins "updated" to ensure that the extracted **Features** remain in the same absolute position relative to each other.

The utility of this **Filter** is that complex thresholding based on **Feature** attributes can be difficult in ParaView (due to memory) and this can greatly reduce the amount of information that is loaded if only the extracted **Feature Data Containers** are loaded for viewing. 

*Note:* Storing each extracted volume as a new **Data Container** can result in a large number of **Data Containers** depending on how many **Features** are "flagged".
