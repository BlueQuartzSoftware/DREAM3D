Extract Flagged Features (Rogues Gallery) {#extractflaggedfeatures}
=====

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Sampling Filters (Cropping/Cutting)


## Description ##
This filter, using a boolean array identifying **Features** to be *extracted*, crops out the smallest bounding box around each **Feature** of interest.  First, the filter determines the bounding box ((xMin-xMax), (yMin-yMax), (zMin-zMax)) for each **Feature**.  Then, the filter checks to see if the **Feature** has been 'flagged' for extraction.  If the **Feature** is to be extracted, the bounding box is used to define a volume for cropping.  The cropped volume for each extracted **Feature** is stored as a new *DataContainer*.  The cropped volumes will have their origins "updated" to ensure that the extracted **Features** remain in the same absolute position relative to each other.

The utility of this filter is that complex thresholding based on **Feature** attributes can be difficult in *Paraview* (due to memory) and this can greatly reduce the amount of information that is loaded if only the extracted **Feature** *DataContainers* are loaded for viewing. 

**Note that storing each extracted volume as a new *DataContainer* can result in a large number of *DataContainers* depending on how many **Features** are 'flagged'.
