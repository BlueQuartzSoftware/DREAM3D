Regularize Z Spacing 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Sampling (Resolution)

## Description ##

This **Filter** "resamples" the 3D array in the Z-direction (which is generally taken as the sectioning direction).  The **Image Geometry** assumes all **Cells** are of the same size (dx x dy x dx).  If the Z locations (i.e., slice positions) are not uniform, then the user can enter a list of the actual Z locations and a desired uniform "resolution".  The format of the list file is each Z slice position on a separate line. The **Filter** will then create a new volume with uniform Z locations and determine which of the old "slices" should be copied to the new "slices". Below is an example:

If a dataset had 10 sections with the following locations:

|Old Slice # |Old Slice Location|
|---------|---------|
|0|0|
|1|3|
|2|7|
|3|12|
|4|14|
|5|19|
|6|24|
|7|25|
|8|30|
|9|34|

and the user wanted a uniform resolution of *3*, then the following mapping would occur 

|New Slice # | New Slice Location |Old Slice # Used|
|---------|---------|---------|
|0|0|0|
|1|3|1|
|2|6|2|
|3|9|2|
|4|12|3|
|5|15|4|
|6|18|5|
|7|21|5|
|8|24|6|
|9|27|7|
|10|30|8|
|11|33|9|

*Note:* No interpolation of the data is performed and the nearest "old slice" is copied to a given "new slice".
