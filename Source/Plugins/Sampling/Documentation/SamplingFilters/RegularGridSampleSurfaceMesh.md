# Sample Triangle Geometry on Regular Grid  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Sampling (Resolution)

## Description ##

This **Filter** "samples" a triangulated surface mesh on a rectilinear grid. The user can specify the number of **Cells** along the X, Y, and Z directions in addition to the resolution in each direction and origin to define a rectilinear grid.  The sampling is then performed by the following steps:

1. Determine the bounding box and **Triangle** list of each **Feature** by scanning all **Triangles** and noting the **Features** on either side of the **Triangle**
2. For each **Cell** in the rectilinear grid, determine which bounding box(es) they fall in (*Note:* the bounding box of multiple **Features** can overlap)
3. For each bounding box a **Cell** falls in, check against that **Feature's** **Triangle** list to determine if the **Cell** falls within that n-sided polyhedra (*Note:* if the surface mesh is conformal, then each **Cell** will only belong to one **Feature**, but if not, the last **Feature** the **Cell** is found to fall inside of will *own* the **Cell**)
4. Assign the **Feature** number that the **Cell** falls within to the *Feature Ids* array in the new rectilinear grid geometry
