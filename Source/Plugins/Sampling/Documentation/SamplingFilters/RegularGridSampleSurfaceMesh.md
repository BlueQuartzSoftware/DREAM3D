Sample Surface Mesh on Regular Grid {#regulargridsamplesurfacemesh}

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Sampling Filters (Resolution)


## Description ##
This filter 'samples' a triangulated surface mesh on a rectilinear grid.  The user can specify the number of **Cells** along the X, Y, and Z directions in addition to the resolution in each direction to define a rectilinear grid.  The sampling is then performed by the following steps:

1. Determine the bounding box  and **Triangle** list of each **Feature** by scanning all **Triangles** and noting the **Features** on either side of the **Triangle**.
2. For each **Cell** in the rectilinear grid, determine which bounding box(es) they fall in (Note: the bounding box of multiple **Features** can overlap)
3. For each bounding box a **Cell** falls in, check against that **Feature's** **Triangle** list to determine if the **Cell** falls within that n-sided polyhedra. (Note: if the surface mesh is conformal, then each **Cell** will only belong to one **Feature**, but if not, the last **Feature** the **Cell** is found to fall inside of will *own* the **Cell**)
4. Assign the **Feature** number that the **Cell** falls within to the *FeatureIds* array in the new rectilinear grid geometry.
