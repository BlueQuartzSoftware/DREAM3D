Read Feature Info File 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

IO (Input)

## Description ##

This **Filter** reads information about an existing set of **Feature** into the a new **Feature Attribute Matrix**. The basic format of the file is the number of **Features** on the first line of the file followed by columnar formatted data listing the **Feature** Id, **Ensemble** Id, Euler Angle 1, Euler Angle 2 and Euler Angle 3. Currently, only the **Ensemble** Id and Euler angle information can be read using this **Filter**.

*If you do not have Euler Angle data for each **Feature** then substituting Zero (0.0) is fine.*

**Feature** and **Ensemble** Ids start from one (1) in DREAM.3D. DREAM.3D uses the zero (0) index internally which has several ramifications that the user needs to understand. Statistics will **not** be calculated for any **Feature** or **Ensemble** with an Id value of zero (0). If your segmented data numbering starts with Zero (0), then the user needs to find a way to renumber **Feature**=0 to another value, typically the max Id + 1. For example, if you have a file with 123 **Features** and 2 **Ensembles** then the file would be similar to the following: 

## Example Input ##

For example, if you have a file with 123 **Features** and 2 **Ensembles** then the file would be similar to the following:

    123
    1   2  1.2  0.4  0.8
    2   1  0.8  0.99  1.0
    .....
    121 1 0.3  0.5  0.9
    123 2 1.0  1.1  0.03
