Export Abaqus Surface Mesh {#abaqussurfacemeshwriter}
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##
IO (Output)

## Description ##
This **Filter** writes an Abaqus file that is a surface mesh using S3 Elements. There are 3 sections to this INP File: Nodes, Elements and Sets of Elements for each **Feature**. This file represents a triangular based mesh with 'shell' elements. No boundary elements are written. The element type selected is TRI_ELEMENT_TYPE "SFM3D3" for the triangles.

**This file is an experimental output from DREAM.3D. The user is responsible for verifying all elements in Abaqus.**
