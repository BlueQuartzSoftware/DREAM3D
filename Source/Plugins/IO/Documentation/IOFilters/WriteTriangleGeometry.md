Write Triangle Geometry {#writetrianglegeometry}

## Group (Subgroup) ##
IO (Output)

## Description ##

This filter creates 2 files from the Vertices and Triangles from a Triangle Geometry. The basic form of the files is simple ASCII where the *vertices* are a "Shared Vertex List" and the *triangles* consist of 3 values where each value is the index into the **vertex** list.

**Example Nodes File**

	# All lines starting with '#' are comments
	# DREAM.3D Nodes file
	# DREAM.3D Version 6.1.92.0613671
	# Node Data is X Y Z space delimited.
	Node Count: 57920
	 0.00000  0.00000  0.00000
	 0.00000  0.50000  0.00000
	 0.00000  0.00000  0.50000

**Example Triangles File**

	# All lines starting with '#' are comments
	# DREAM.3D Triangle file
	# DREAM.3D Version 6.1.92.0613671
	# Each Triangle consists of 3 Node Ids.
	# NODE IDs START AT 0.
	Node Count: 57920
