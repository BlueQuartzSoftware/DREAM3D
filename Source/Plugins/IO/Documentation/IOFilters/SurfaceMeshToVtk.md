Write Vtk PolyData File (From SurfaceMesh) 
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##

I/O Filters (Output)

## Description ##

This filter will create a "legacy" vtk file (.vtk) that contains the POINTS and POLYGONS, where each POLYGON is a triangle.
In addition the NODE_TYPE will be written as POINT_DATA and the GRAIN_ID will be written as CELL_DATA. There are 2 options
for this filter.

__Write Binary Vtk File__ If this option is selected then the data portions of the file will be written in Big Endian
binary format as stipulated by the VTK file format.

## Parameters ##
