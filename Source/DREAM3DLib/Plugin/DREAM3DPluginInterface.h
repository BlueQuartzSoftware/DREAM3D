/**
 * @class DREAM3DPluginInterface DREAM3DPluginInterface.h IPHelper/plugins/DREAM3DPluginInterface.h
 * @brief This class defines the interface used by plugins that would like to process
 * images and display their output.
 * @author Michael A. Jackson for BlueQuartz Software
 * @date Jul 10, 2010
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *  In order to develop a plugin for the IPHelper there are several classes that need to be
 *  implemented by the developer.

 *
 *  The developer should implement all three classes in their own plugin in order to
 *  have a fully functioning plugin that is able to display an input GUI and process
 *  the input images.
 *
 * @subsection plugin_interface PluginInterface
 *    The developer should create a C++ class that inherits publicly from DREAM3DPluginInterface and
 *    QObject.
 *    @code
 *    class MyPlugin : public QObject, public DREAM3DPluginInterface {
 *    @endcode
 *
 *    The developer will also need to add some macro declarations to their class declaration (usually
 *     in the header file.
 *
 *    @code
 *      Q_OBJECT
 *      Q_INTERFACES(DREAM3DPluginInterface )
 *    @endcode
 *    The programmer will also need to add the following macros to their implementation file.
 *    @code
 *    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2(MyPlugin, MyPlugin);
 *    @endcode
 *
 *    At this point the developer is ready to implement each of the virtual functions in the
 *    DREAM3DPluginInterface in order to make their plugin valid
 *
 * @subsection plugin_inputui PluginInputUI
 *   In order for the user to be able to set the proper inputs for thier image
 *   processing code the developer will need to design a QWidget based input UI
 *   using QtDesigner or by hand if they wish. An existing class QImageProcessingInputFrame
 *   already has some existing functionality that the developer may wish to readily inherit
 *   from. If that is the case then the developer can simply inherit from QImageProcessingInputFrame
 *   instead of another Qt class as is the norm for QtDesigner based widgets. See the
 *   Qt documentation if you are unfamiliar with how to use Qt Designer to create a GUI.
 *
 * @subsection plugin_task PluginTask
 *  If the developer would like to take advantage of the ProcessQueueController and the
 *  ProcessQueueDialog facilities
 *  that are available then they can create a MyPluginTask class that inherits from
 *  the ProcessQueueTask class. They simply need to implement the <tt>run()</tt> method.
