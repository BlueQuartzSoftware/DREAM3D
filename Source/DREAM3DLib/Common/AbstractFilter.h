/**
 * @class AbstractFilter AbstractFilter.h DREAM3DLib/Common/AbstractFilter.h
 * @brief This class is the basic class to subclass when creating a new Filter for
 * DREAM.3D. The subclass must implement at least the  execute method. If an
 * error occurs during the execution of the filter set the errorCondition to
 * a non zero value and optionally use the setErrorMessage() method to explain what the
 * error was. This class also inherits from Observable so that the filter can
 * provide updates to the user interface during execution.
