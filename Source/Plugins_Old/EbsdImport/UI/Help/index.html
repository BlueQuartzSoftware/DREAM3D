  <h3>EBSD Data Import</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><b><i>Input Directory</i></b> - Directory where the input files are located
      <ul>
        <li>Total EBSD Files Found - Code will determine how many .ang or .ctf files are present.
        <li>Currently only .ang and .ctf files are supported.
      </ul>
    <li><b><i>Parameters</i></b>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Stacking Order</i></b> - This parameter sets the order in which the slices will be stacked.
        If Low to High is selected, then the lowest slice number will be interpreted to be at z = 0
        and the largest slice number will be interpreted to be at z = (no. of slices * z resolution).
        If High to Low is selected, then the opposite is the case where the lowest slice number is 
        interpreted as z = (no. of slices *z resolution) and the largest slice number is z = 0.  The 
        filenames in the file list should be reordered to disply the choice of stacking order. 
        <li><b><i>Reference Frame Options</i></b> -  This button brings up a pop-up that asks the user to answer 
        questions about what post-processing needs to be done to account for details of the  data 
        collection process.
        <br/>

        <br/>
          <ul>
            <li> <b><i>Rotate 2D scan</i></b> - Generally when EBSD scans are collected in an SEM, the sample is being
            viewed upside-down and the long working distance of the sample is at the top of the scan.  This 
            typically means the "top" of you sample is at the bottom of the scan.  If you have applied a 180
            degree scan rotation to the image in the SEM prior to EBSD collection, then the sample has already been
            "rotated" and this box should not be check, otherwise it is our suggestion to select this option.
            <li> <b><i>Set 0,0 position at Lower Left</i></b> - This option accounts for the fact that the commercial EBSD data 
            collection packages raster through the scan starting at the upper left.  As a result the first data point
            is not at the actual 0,0 position relative to your sample.  The analysis codes in this package assume the 
            first data point in the array is the 0,0 coordinate of the spatial reference frame.  Unless you have 
            reordered the points coming out of the EBSD scan, then we highly recommend you leave this option clicked.
            <li> <b><i>Align Euler Reference Frame</i></b> - This option addresses the fact that the commercial EBSD collection programs
            use different reference frames for spatial coordinates and Euler angles.  Clicking this option will bring 
            these two reference frames into coincidence.  Unless you have rotated the Eulers angles yourself, we recommend
            you turn this option on.   
          </ul>
      </ul>
    <li><b><i>Z spacing</i></b> - This is the spacing between sections
      <ul>
        <li>Note that the x and y spacings are automatically read from
          the input files.  If the x and y spacing values change, the ones in the first
          section are used.
      </ul>
    
    <li><b><i>Output File</i></b> - Name and location of desired output .h5ebsd file

    <li><b><i>File Prefix, Suffix and File Extension</i></b> - Variables that are combined to generate the list of file names
      <ul>
        <li>These values may be automatically populated, but
          should be checked to make sure the proper filenames are appearing in the file list.
      </ul>
    <li><b><i>Start Slice, End Slice and Padding Digits</i></b> - More
      variables that are combined to generate the list of file names
      <ul>
        <li>Start slice and end slice define the range of data to be
          included in the .h5ang file (i.e. you do not have to import the entire
          dataset).
        <li>Padding digits controls the number of leading zeros that are
          present in the filename.
      </ul>
    <li><b><i>File List</i></b> - This area lists all the files that will be included 
    in the .h5ebsd file based on the inputs chosen.
      <ul>
        <li>The files in the list will have a green dot if they are
          present in the directory selected and a red dot if they are not
          present. If any items show a red dot the corrections should be made to
          the text fields that control how the file names are generated so that 
          everything file is explicity listed with a green dot.
      </ul>
  </ol>
