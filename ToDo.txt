This is just a To Do List:

Ang Import:
* Better Display of errors when importing to help user fix their data

Reconstruction:
* Fix 2 Phase Crashing bug - Bad output file is written
* Rework existing user interface for showing output file that will be written and
indicate which files will be over written during execution.
* Indicate with a set of images what is meant for the "Oreintation" of the Ang Data

GrainGenerator:
* Rework existing user interface for showing output file that will be written and
indicate which files will be over written during execution.
* Confirm Crashing bug in Destructor of GrainGeneratorFunc is fixed. 
* Switch to defining Dimensions and resolution of the volume to be created
* Real time indicate the average grain size, number of grains as user inputs values
into the user interface
* Stop reading MicroTexture from the HDF5 Input file


Surface Meshing:
* Output STL File per grain
* Fix bug in assign_grains();


2D to 3D Module:
* Create new tab for this interface which will generate 3D Stats from a set of 
2D statistics or input files

Misc:
* Move all the stats functions to their own class out of the Reconstruction and
GrainGenerator modules
* Add new tab "Calculate Stats" which will use existing grain structure files as
the input.
* Stop Calculating MicroTexture

StatsGenerator:
* Rolled Preset Dialog needs to be redone and made "idiot" proof.
* When switching between presets the ODF/MDF tables are NOT cleared as they should be.


Infrastructure Changes:
* Move each UI Tab Module to be an actual Plugin library.
* Redesign Main User Interface to load an individual Tab at a time through a menu
instead of having all the tabs.
* Move to a more modular pipeline architecture for each of the Modules where we start
mimicing a VTK filter pipeline.
