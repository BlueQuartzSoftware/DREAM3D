# DREAM.3D  #

DREAM.3D is an open source, cross-platform and modular software package that allows users to reconstruct, instantiate, quantify, mesh, handle and visualize multidimensional, multimodal data. The core software package has many major functionalities, including:

+ Import a series of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data files (either TSL .ang or HKL .ctf) or images (.bmp, .jpeg, .tif or .png) as a 3D volume and export the data packed into a single HDF5 data file in order to reduce data size and clutter
+ Alignment, cleaning, reconstruction, segmentation and analysis of imported data
+ Statistics, either synthetically created or from real data, can be used to generate a statistically equivelent material structure
+ Reconstructed and synthetic volumes can be surfaced meshed to allow export into FEM or other simulations.

The above items represent only a subset of the specific capabilities of DREAM.3D.  In general, DREAM.3D can be considered a generic tool for processing multidimensional, multimodal data. The main [DREAM.3D web site](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net) has more information on the project, in addition to official binary distributions and example data files. DREAM.3D is built with a **Plugin** system that allows other institutions to build additional **Filters** using their own programming resources and intellectual property and still protect those rights under the BSD license.

## Nightly Builds ##
Nightly snapshot builds are available for download [here](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/binaries/experimental/). These binaries are built every night from the head of the develop branch, and may have bugs or other instabilities.
