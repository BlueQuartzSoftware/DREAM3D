# DREAM3D  #

## Information ##
DREAM3D is an environment to archive, process and represent microstructure data in a digital form. DREAM3D has many built in filters that allow the user to reconstruct and analyze 3D microstructure data, generate synthetic microstructures and archive data files. The current suite of filters has a strong influence from the EBSD community as the original data sets analyzed were from various EBSD systems. The main DREAM3D [web site](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net) has more information in addition to official binary distributions and example data files. DREAM3D is built with a plugin system that allows other institutions to build additional filters using their own programming resources and Intellectual Property and still protect those rights under the BSD license.

## License ##

DREAM3D is open-source and available under a BSD license. See the License.txt file that comes with the project for more information.
