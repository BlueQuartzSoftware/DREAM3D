DREAM3D Development ToDo List {#todo}
===============

This is the list of things to do. It is written with the Markdown style so it can be integrated with the other documentation pages.

## Show Stopping Bugs ##

+ Fix EBSDLib to understand more Crystal Symmetries in TSL .ang files.
+ Synthetic Microstructure generation tutorial needs to be updated with the additional filters that are required for Match Crystallography to work properly.
+ Convert Hex to Square needs to create an output directory for the files as the default output files are not readily recognized by the Import Orientation data filter which is a break down of User interaction

## Critical to Fix before Bad Things Happen ##
+ All the shape ops classes need to be fully reentrant for parallel applications
