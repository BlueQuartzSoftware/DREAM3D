# DREAM3D Release Notes #

## Important Changes in Version 4.2 ##

### TSL Reference Frame Changes ###

Versions prior to 4.2 did not correctly set the sample and crystal reference frame transformations when importing data into an .h5ebsd file. This bug has been corrected but due to changes within the .h5ebsd file the user is *strongly* encouraged to reimport any .ang data files an rerun any pipelines that depend on that data. More information can be found in the "Import Orientation Data" documentation.

### Changes to Internal Quaternion Structure ###
For historical compatibility in versions prior to 4.2 the internal representation of a quaternion was a 5 component array for each quaternion. This compatibility is no longer needed and the internal structure has been changed to a standard (X, Y, Z, W) style quaternion. This will create issues when loading .dream3d files that were created with versions prior to 4.2 into DREAM3D versions 4.2 and beyond. In order to alleviate migration issues a new filter in the "Update Cell Quaternions" located in the "Generic" section of the filter library will convert existing 5 component quaternions to the newer 4 component layout. If the user would like to simply update their .dream3d file the pipeline to accomplish this would be:

+ Read DREAM3D File (Check EVERY array to read)
+ Update Cell Quaternions
+ Write DREAM3D File (Check EVERY array to write)

**Note: This pipeline will OVERWRITE the existing DREAM3D File if both the input and output files are the same file.**

## Version 4.2 Bugs Fixed & Features Added ##

## Version 4.2.4685 ###
+ Updating issue no. *114*: Adding Experimental "Write Pole Figure" filter which is only allowable for some Laue groups
+ Fixed issue no. *128*: Fixing Bugs in the Alignment filters due to mis-use of C++ inheritance rules.
+ Fixed issue no. *110*: Adding an "Update Favorite" to the DREAM3D contextual menu. This will update the selected favorite with the current pipeline.
+ Fixed issue no. *109*: Backporting all the Crystal Orientation Operations classes from the development branch to allow more functionality in certain filters
+ Fixed issue no. *129*: Fixing issue with "Import Orientation Data" filter when large EBSD scans were imported the Reference Frame Dialog would resize larger than the screen making use of the dialog impossible. This has been fixed with a QGraphicsView layout and basic zooming capabilities.
+ Fixed issue with the EBSD .ang reader to report an error if the "Phase" header entry is never found which can happen on some TSL "combo" scans.
+ Fixed issue no. *130*: Estimated Time remaining for Synthetic generation was not correct.

+ Updated the documentation for the "Find Average Orientations" filter
+ Clarifying an error message that is produced when a filter requests an array from the Data Container but the array stored in the Data container does not match type and/or size and/or number of components.
