Historical Note:

The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) was initially developed
under contract to the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes
of Health. ITK is partially derived from VTK and VXL, hence some code is
copyrighted accordingly (see VTKCopyright.txt and VXLCopyright.txt).

The copyright of most of the files in the "Utilities" subdirectory is held by
third parties who allow to distribute this material under a license compatible
with the one used by ITK. Please read the content of the subdirectories for
specific details on those third-party licenses. You will also find details in
the README.txt file under the "Copyright" subdirectory.

Starting with its version ITK 3.6, The Insight Toolkit is distributed under the
new and simplified BSD license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)
[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php].
