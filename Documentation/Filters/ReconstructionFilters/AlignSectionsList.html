<h4>Summary</h4>
<!-- Write all your documentation here -->
In this filter, the user can point to a .txt file that has shifts
already calculated in it.  These shifts could be from some source (e.g., one of the other filters and then manually modified, or manually determined
in Photoshop, etc.) <br><br>
 The format of the file is as follows: 
<br>
<i>slice number, xshift, yshift<br>
slice number, xshift, yshift <br>
slice number, xshift, yshift<br>
etc...</i>
<br>
<br>

Note: there are other filters write out a .txt file with shifts in it; so
the user could change those values, then read them back in with this
filter if they didn't like a shift the other filter made.
