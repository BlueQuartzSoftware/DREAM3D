<h4>Summary</h4>
<!-- Write all your documentation here -->
This filter segments 2D slices, creates grain Ids that are used to determine the mutual information and then aligns the slices. These grain ids are temporary, and they apply to this filter only. So they are not related to the GrainIds generated in other filters.<br>
<br>
The user choses the level of misorientation tolerance by which to align voxels, where here the tolerance means the misorientation cannot exceed a given value. If the rotation angle is below the tolerance, then the voxel is grouped with other voxels that satisfy the criterion.<br>
<br>
The approach used in this filter is to group neighboring voxels on a slice that have a misorientation below the tolerance the user entered. Misorientation here means the minimum rotation angle of one voxel's crystal axis to coincide with another voxel's crystal axis. When the grains in the slices are defined, they are moved until 'disks' in neighboring slices align with each other.

Mutual information is one of many quantities that measures how much one random variable
tells us about another. It is a dimensionless quantity with (generally) units of bits, and can be
thought of as the reduction in uncertainty about one random variable given knowledge of another.
High mutual information indicates a large reduction in uncertainty; low mutual information
indicates a small reduction; and zero mutual information between two random variables
means the variables are independent.
