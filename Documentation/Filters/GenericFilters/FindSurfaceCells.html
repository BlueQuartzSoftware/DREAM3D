<h4>Summary</h4>
<!-- Write all your documentation here -->
This filter determines which cells are on the surface of a field (i.e. the field/grain boundary).  This is accomplished by iterating through the cells and querying each cell's neighboring cells to determine if they have a different field owner.  A cell is said to be a surface cell if any one of its neighboring cells has a different field owner. </br>
Note that all cells that lie on the outer surface of the sample will also be called surface cells. </br>
