## Minimum Supported Compiler Versions ##

DREAM.3D is written in C\++ and the developers utilize features from the C\+\+11 specification so therefor
any C\+\+ compiler that is used **MUST** be C\+\+11 compliant.

A compiler suite (Visual Studio, Xcode, GCC, etc.) for your operating system is necessary. 
The following table lists the compilers that DREAM.3D is commonly compiled against.

DREAM.3D is compiled as a 64 bit application and libraries on all operating systems. 32 Bit support
has been removed and is no longer under active development.
