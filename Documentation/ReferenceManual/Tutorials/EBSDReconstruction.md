3D Orientation Data Reconstruction {#tutorialebsdreconstruction}
========

With the advent of 3D EBSD data collection systems the visualization of the collected data is typically the first order of business. Using the sample data set _Small IN100_ which is a Nickel based super alloy we can use DREAM3D to build a 3D reconstruction of the 2D slices. The order of operations for this type of work flow is the following:

1. [Convert the Orientation Data](ebsdtoh5ebsd.html) to an H5Ebsd based archive file.
2. [Read H5Ebsd file](readh5ebsd.html).
3. [Determine which voxels are considered good](multithresholdcells.html).
4. [Find the Quaternions for each Cell](findcellquats.html).
5. [Align the sections](alignSectionsmisorientation.html) using a Misorientation Alignment filter
6. [Segment the grains](ebsdsegmentgrains.html) using a Misorientation Algorithm.
7. [Generate the IPF](generateipfcolors.html) (Inverse Pole Figure) colors based on the Euler Angles.
8. [Write out a DREAM3D](datacontainerwriter.html) data file (with optional Xdmf file).

After running the pipeline [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org) can be used to display the generated Xdmf file. There are a few options within ParaView that need to be set in order to show the encoded IPF colors otherwise ParaView will create a random color table for the visualization.

1. Set the representation to _Surface_
2. Set the color by to _IPFColor_
3. Click the little gear icon to show the advanced options
4. Uncheck the **Map Scalars** and **Interpolate Scalars**.

After all of these options are set the visualized volume will display with the encoded IPF Colors. The user is free to use what ever coloring scheme they would like for example coloring by the phase or Grain Id will also show grain boundaries.
