## Introduction ##
DevHelper is a developer tool that allows the user to generate a new plugin with one or more filters, or generate a new filter inside an existing plugin.  It is highly recommended that developers use this tool to create their plugins and filters, because it provides all of the skeleton code required to compile the plugin or filter successfully with DREAM3D.
