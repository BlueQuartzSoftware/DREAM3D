## History of DREAM.3D ##
The history of DREAM.3D is rooted in two parallel research efforts:  

+ The first was the graduate research project of Michael Groeber, under the advisement of Dr. Somnath Ghosh, at The Ohio State University (2003-2007).  The key developments under this project were the creation of many of DREAM.3D's current filters for reconstructing serial-section experimental datasets, quantifying microstructural features in 3D and generating statistically equivalent microstructures. 
+ The second research effort was carried out by the research group of Tony Rollett at Carnegie Mellon University over a number of graduate student projects (see names below) and years (~2000-2011).  The key developments under these projects were the development of a synthetic microstructure builder, microstructure clean-up tools, surface mesh generation and quantification tools for microstructural features.



## Funding Sources ##
Parts of DREAM3D were written under US Air Force (AFRL) Contract FA8650-07-D-5800 and Navy Research Labs (NRL) Contract N00173-07-C-2068. Many others have contributed to the code including the following:
