Read Ensemble Info File {#ensembleinforeader}
======
## Group (Subgroup) ##
IO Filters (Input)

## Description ##
This filter reads in information about the Crystal Structure and Phases of
 all the **Fields** that are contained in a **Cell** based volume. These
 values are needed to allow the calculation of statistics on the volume.
 The format of that file is a simple text file where the first line is the
 number of phases that are contained in the volume and subsequent lines in
 the file list the __Phase Number__, __Crystal Structure__ and __Phase Type__.
 The proper values for the crystal structure and phase type come from internal
 constants within DREAM3D and are listed here:

**Crystal Structure**

- Hexagonal = 0
- Cubic = 1
- OrthoRhombic = 2
- AxisOrthoRhombic = 3
- UnknownCrystalStructure = 999

**Phase Type**

- PrimaryPhase = 0
- PrecipitatePhase = 1
- TransformationPhase = 2
- MatrixPhase = 3
- BoundaryPhase = 4
- UnknownPhaseType = 999
__Phase numbering starts at One (1). Phase Zero (0) is reserved for internal use in DREAM3D.__
For example if you have a structure that has 2 phases that consist of a Cubic Primary phase and a Hexagonal Matrix phase the file would be the following:


    2
    1  1  0
    2  0  3
