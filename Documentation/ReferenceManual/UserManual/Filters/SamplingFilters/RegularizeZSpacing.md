Regularize Z Spacing {#regularizezspacing}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Sampling Filters (Resolution)

## Description ##
This filter "resamples" the 3D array in the *Z*-direction (which is generally taken as the setioning direction).  The *Voxel* data container assumes all **Cells** are of the same size.  If the *Z* locations (i.e. slice positions) are not uniform, then the user can enter a list of the actual *Z* locations and a desired uniform "resolution".  The filter will then create a new volume with uniform *Z* locations and determine which of the old "slices" should be copied to the new "slices". Below is an example:


If a dataset had 10 sections with the following locations:

|Old Slice # |Old Slice Location|
|---------|---------|
|0|0|
|1|3|
|2|7|
|3|12|
|4|14|
|5|19|
|6|24|
|7|25|
|8|30|
|9|34|

and the user wanted a uniform resolution of *3*, then the following mapping woud occur 

|New Slice # | New Slice Location |Old Slice # Used|
|---------|---------|---------|
|0|0|0|
|1|3|1|
|2|6|2|
|3|9|2|
|4|12|3|
|5|15|4|
|6|18|5|
|7|21|5|
|8|24|6|
|9|27|7|
|10|30|8|
|11|33|9|

Note: there is no interpolation of the data and the nearest "old slice" is copied to a given "new slice".
