Align Sections (List) {#alignsectionslist}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Reconstruction Filters (Alignment)

## Description ##
This Filter accepts a _.txt_ file that has full **Cells** shifts that have already been calculated in it.  
The format of the file is as follows: 

    slice number, xshift, yshift
    slice number, xshift, yshift 
    slice number, xshift, yshift
    etc...
**Note**: some/many of the other alignment filters write out a **txt** file with their calculated shifts in it; so
the user could manually modify those values, and then use them in this filter if the shifts in the other filter were deemed unsatisfactory.
