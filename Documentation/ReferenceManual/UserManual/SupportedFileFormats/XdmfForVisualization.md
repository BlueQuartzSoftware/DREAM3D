XDMF For Visualization {#xdmf}
========

## Introduction ##
[XDMF](http://www.xdmf.org) is an XML file that describes either a regular grid or unstructured grid data set where the data can be stored in an HDF5, Binary or with the xml file itself. The user is can find out more information for this format at the [Xdmf website](http://www.xdmf.org). DREAM3D will optionally write out an Xdmf file when writing a DREAM3D Data file so that users can view the processed data easily using the free [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org) application. In prior versions of DREAM3D the only way to view the data was to write out a legacy VTK file which can be slow and simply duplicates much of the data that is stored in the .dream3d file. This is a waste of space and not memory efficient when it comes to ParaView loading the data from the legacy .vtk file.

--------

By using an Xdmf wrapper file the user can selectively load just the data that they are interested in viewing. This saves time loading the data and more importantly reduces the amount of memory needed to load, store and view the data.

**Note**: It is a REQUIREMENT that the Xdmf file and the DREAM3D file are in the same directory because paths in the XDMF file refer to data stored in the DREAM3D file. The XML files are typically a few kilobytes in size and are therefor a huge savings over writing the VTK file for the same data.

## XDMF Example Contents ##
Below is an example of what an Xdmf file might contain.
