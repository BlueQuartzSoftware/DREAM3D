## The Filter Library | Prebuilt Pipelines | Favorite Pipelines 
  **Area 1**: This area of the user interface is broken into 3 basic groups: Filter Library, Prebuilt Pipelines and Favorite pipelines. The _Filter Library_ section contains the various groups that the filters are organized into. The user can click a specific group and just the filters associated with that group will be displayed in the _Filter List_ area of the user interface. DREAM3D provides several _Prebuilt Pipelines_ that can aid the new user in getting started with DREAM3D. Simply double clicking a preset will clear any current filters in the pipeline area and populate the pipeline area with the filters from the Pipeline Preset. After the user builds a pipeline that they may want to save for later the user can click the "Add Favorites" button to save that specific pipeline configuration.

## Filter List
  **Area 2**:This section lists the filters that are associated with a specific group that is selected in the _Filter Library_ area. If the _Filter Library_ is itself selected then all filters will be shown in this list.


## Pipeline Area
  **Area 3**:This area is where the user will construct their pipeline by either double clicking on a filter in the library area or dragging a filter from the Filter List and dropping the filter into the pipeline area. Filters in this section can be rearranged by simply dragging the filter into a new location.


##  Errors area
 **Area 4**: This area displays any errors associated with the filter if it is actively being used in a pipeline. The display of the errors can be toggled on and off by pressing the appropriate buttons.
