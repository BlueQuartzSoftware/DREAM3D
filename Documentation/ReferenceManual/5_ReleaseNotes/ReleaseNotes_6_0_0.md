# Major Changes #

This is a major version update with breaking changes that will invalidate any previous .dream3d file and pipeline. Breaking changes are:


+ The core DREAM.3D data structure has been rewritten. **This is a major change that breaks compatibility with previous DREAM.3D version files. Files generated with a version of DREAM.3D before v6.x are INCOMPATIBLE with v6.x and any subsequent versions!**
+ Several **Filters** have been renamed or removed. Consult the table below for a detailed list. **The removal or renaming of Filters may break compatibility with Pipelines generated in previous versions of DREAM.3D. Users are encouraged to update their Pipelines to utilize the current Filter suite of v6.x!**
+ Pipeline files are now stored as JSON files instead of INI files
+ .dream3d files now have an updated internal structure that is not compatible with any previous version of DREAM.3D
+ **Bookmarks** (formerly **Favorites**) now store direct links to the json file on the file system. This means the user can store the bookmarked json file where ever they want.
+ The **User Interface** has been completely updated and mostly rewritten using Qt version 5.
+ Added new filter searching field which allows the user to easily find filters by name
+ Prebuilt Pipelines have all been updated with bug fixes
+ Internal data structures have been updated to allow DREAM.3D to scale better to larger datasets.
+ DREAM.3D now contains over 200 filters to process data

[0] Test files are not available to verify proper output is being created  
[1] Introduction of dedicated **Geometry** classes allow us to remove this **Filter**
[2] Original developer is not updating this **Filter** any longer
[3] This **Filter** is considered legacy and no longer supported 
[4] This **Filter** is removed for technical reasons 

+ Several improvements to the user interface have been made. Consult the updated user manual for details. Most importantly, DREAM.3D now utilizes a document model for its interface, which will allow users to have multiple instances of DREAM.3D open at once, all operating independently.
+ The core code for orientation transformations has been redone based on the work of M. De Graef et al.
+ Many major and minor bug issues addressed.

# Known Issues #

+ The DDDAnalysisToolbox, ImageProcessing, HEDMAnalysis, and TransformationPhase curated **Plugins** are temporarily moved to the _Unsupported_ group until they are updated to the current DREAM.3D standards for code and documentation. These **Plugins** will be moved out of _Unsupported_ as they are updated.
+ The "rolled" preset dialog does not currently verify if the user has entered values such that A > B > C, which may result in incorrect statistics. The user should be aware of this and make sure to enter values such that A > B > C. A check of this condition will be added in a future release.
+ The Match Crystallography **Filter** may intermittenly crash.
