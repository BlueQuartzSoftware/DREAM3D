These release notes summarize the major changes for each officially released version of DREAM.3D. The official bug report is located at the [DREAM.3D GitHub issues page](https://github.com/bluequartzsoftware/DREAM3D/issues).

## Getting Help ##

The developers of DREAM.3D maintain a pair of Google Groups for discussions on the use of DREAM.3D and the development of filters or plugins for DREAM.3D. If you have a question those are the best places to ask and get help from the community.

## Version 6.5.36 ##

### New Filters & Features ###

No new features or filters were added. This bug fix is mainly a bug fix release based on feedback from users.

### Fixed DREAM3D Issues ###

+ Pack Primary Phases and Insert Precipitates now use "Feature Generation" filter parameter instead of "Alread Have Features"
+ Issue #809: changed the Feature Attribute Array Default Name from "AxisLengths" to "SemiAxisLengths," with other consistency changes (J. Tucker)
+ Issue #808: Adjust the min height of vertical tabs for some visual styles.
+ Issue #803: FindSizes overflow on large data
+ Issue #799: Allow FeatureInfoReader to accept comments in the file
+ Update prebuild pipelines that use the PackPrimaryPhases filter
+ Remove 'Input Stats File' for the estimation of number of features
+ Update documentation for PackPrimaryPhases (A.D. Rollett)
+ Update the Reference Frame documentation with edits from M.D. Graef.
+ Promote the "Detect Ellipsoids" filter into the Processing plugin

### Fixed SIMPLView Issues ###

+ Updating the text in the dialog box that appears when the SIMPL_RELATIVE_PATH_CHECK CMake variable is On and no data directory path has been set previously.  The dialog text is now consistent with the menu system text when telling users how to set a different data directory location.

### Fixed SIMPL Issues ###

+ Import HDF5 Dataset: Now import multiple datasets per filter. Better guessing for the component dimensions
+ Fix bug where filter parameters were shared among multiple filter instances in certain situations.
+ Fixed a bug where moving a filter would incorrectly prevent the filter from being deleted, thus causing the move to behave like a copy and place the same filter into the pipeline multiple times.
+ Fixed a bug in PipelineListWidget where the pipeline could be run even with errors if they were caused during pipeline execution. Updated PipelineListWidget to use an enum to check and change its current state rather than comparing text output to the UI.
+ Disabled the option of reading FilterPipelines from .dream3d files.  If a .dream3d file is dropped into the pipeline view, a Read DREAM.3D Data File filter is automatically created for the file.
+ Fixed a bug where pressing cancel when asked if the user wants to import a .dream3d file as a pipeline or as an import data filter would not cancel the import process.
+ Issue #215: Fixed
+ Issue #212: Add a Hexahedral geometry class.
+ Promote several filters from DREAM3DReview into SIMPL/Core: Copy Object, Create Geometry, Crop Vertex Geometry, Extract Attribute Arrays from Geometry, Split Attribute Array

## Version 6.5.10 ##
