+ Export 3D Solid Mesh now does not time out
+ ITKImagePairWiseRegistration filter added into DREAM3DReview branch

### 6.5.126 Fixed SIMPL Issues ###

+ Use proper icon in MultiDataContainerSelectionWidget
+ Fix to resolve spurious warnings about QGradient at the end of pipeline execution
+ Fix to itkCommand subclass to properly implement it using ITK Macros
+ Use 'Spacing' instead of 'Resolution' in ImageGeometry descriptive text
+ Addressed arithmetic overflow and other code analysis warnings
+ Initialized PipelineMessage index
+ Marked a possible coding error in ImportAsciiDataArray where two identical error conditions are checked using || operator.
+ Fixed an incorrect cast in ReadASCIIData where a double is cast to a float for a method parameter that is expecting a double.  Due to multiple calculations of the same value, it was saved to a constant before the first calculation was required.
+ Changed a for loop variable in geometry compute methods to avoid default castings when dereferencing a pointer multiple times per iteration.
+ Changed geometry requirements in addAttributeMatrix from using || for enum checks to &&.  The previous versions could never be false and invalidated the entire method.
+ Fixed a possible overflow when calculating ImageGeom and RectGridGeom coords.  The previous versions would have overflowed before casting to a larger size.
+ Updated variables used to store min and max float values to constexpr to take advantage of the fact that they are known at compile time and are never modified.
+ Removed unnecessary casts in SIMPLibRandom where doubles were cast to float and then saved as a double.
+ Fixed ColorTable::GetColorTable due to the current implementation going out of array bounds.  The 2D array float color[8][3] was being accessed with indices [8][2].
+ Updated VTKFileReader::skipVolume to use size_t dimensions
+ Changed xDim, yDim, and zDim parameters to size_t from int.  If either one or three of them were negative, the total size variable used to allocate memory would save a negative number as an unsigned value, causing overflow.  Moreover, any negative dimensions would silently prevent data from being read.
+ Updated ColorTable::GetColorTable with static_cast and rename
+ Updated preset color table only.
+ Removed duplicate error checks in ImportAsciDataArray
+ Other errors are already handled, so these seem to be redundant rather than typos.
+ Updated ColorTable::GetColorTable for json values
+ Applied fixes from preset color table method.
+ Updated incorrect currBinIndex maximum value in preset table method
+ Moved variables inside the loop where appropriate.
+ Updated numColors parameter to size_t both for cast issues and because it makes no sense to have a negative number of colors.
+ Made variables const where appropriate.
+ Ran clang-format on ColorTable.cpp for readability
+ Fixed more arithmetic overflow warnings with type casts
+ Performed casts on getNumberOfComponents() to size_t for calculations.  This method should probably return size_t instead of a signed int if a negative component dimension is not possible.
+ Changed DynamicTableData::ExpandData parameters nRows and nCols from signed int to size_t.  Negative values were not handled, and the values are more descriptive with their current type.  size_t should be preferred over int when it comes to dimensions unless there is a good reason to include negative values as a valid option.
+ Added a hsize_t cast to H5DataArrayWriter when calculating rank size in H5DataArrayWriter.hpp  By casting the first value, arithmetic operations progress it forward while preventing int32_t-related overflow.
+ Added casts to int64_t when faceId values to local variables in GeometryMath.cpp.  These variables were used for referencing vertex pointer indices where int64_t values were expected
+ Fixed a few uninitialized variables
+ Fixed type casting in CubeOctohedronOps.cpp
+ Added missing `f` in plane4Comp and plane7Comp arithmetic operations. This was determined as a mistake by looking at other operations where the same calculations were consistently done with a floating point constant, but the `f` was left off in two places.  The `static_cast<float>`  was determined to silence a warning regarding type casting down from double to float due to the propagation of the double type through the calculation.
+ Added default value to ErrorObject::ok boolean in ParseFunctors
+ Silenced initialized variable warning
+ Added default construction to SIMPLib property macros
+ This is unlikely to affect the default values for integers, floating point numbers, and booleans (not created with SIMPL_BOOL_PROPERTY).
+ Hard sets boolean properties to false using SIMPL_BOOL_PROPERTY
+ Silences uninitialized variable warnings for other types.
+ These macros still have the potential to cause bugs due to uninitialized variables.
+ Added a default initialization for PipelineMessage code.

+ Import HDF5 Dataset: Now import multiple datasets per filter. Better guessing for the component dimensions
