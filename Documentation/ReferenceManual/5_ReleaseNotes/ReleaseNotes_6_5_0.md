## Version 6.5.10 ##

+ Fix a hard crash inside of the DataContainerReader that would prevent the use of the filter within the GUI environment.


## Version 6.5.9 ##

+ Improvements to handling of relative file paths on macOS. There is now a default "DREAM3D Data" directory that is used which is initially set to a directory called "DREAM3DData" and is placed inside the users home directory

## Version 6.5.3 ##

### New Filters & Features ###

+ Implemented a custom style for the BrandedDREAM3D folder where any intrepid developer can use any Qt5 supported CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) codes to completely customize the look of DREAM.3D/SIMPLView.
+ DREAM3D Issue #752: Add filter to reduce orientations to their fundamental zone.
+ Add ability to create discrete pole figures instead of Lambert based pole figures.
+ Pole Figures are now generated as PDF files using libHaru
+ Add new filter that allows the user to summarize a pipeline by entering text into a basic text edit widget
+ Add filter to convert from 3 Component Rodrigues vectors to 4 component
+ Add filter to compute the conjugate of a Quaternioni
+ Add filter to compute the transpose of an Orientation Matrix
+ Updated the organization of the Prebuilt pipelines.

### Fixed DREAM3D Issues ###

+ Add cancel checks for the EMsoftSO3Sampler filter
+ Add information parameter that shows the size of the image geometry in real length units.
+ DREAM3D Issue #755: Implement a read only preflight updated value that states the range and delta for each axis in synthetic volume. This allows better feedback to the user that they are hitting specific size targets that they have in mind.
+ DREAM3D Issue #756: Figure out how to remove the JQuery.js file that Doxygen includes.
+ DREAM3D Issue #758: CMake code in the plugins are not generating any unit test code

+ DREAM3D Issue #764: Add warning to Alignment filters to warn user if any shift is greater than the dimension of the shift
+ DREAM3D Issue #765: Add a minimize button to the Help window.
+ DREAM3D Issue #766: xdmf file name is truncated at the first "." character instead of the last

+ DREAM3D Issue #773: Dream3D crashes when generating ensemble statistics 
+ DREAM3D Issue #774: Parallelize Convert Orientation Representation
+ DREAM3D Issue #775: Segment Features by Misorientation takes too much time reallocating a std::vector. Investigate and fix
+ DREAM3D Issue #777: Qt 5.10.x & StatsGenerator Progress windows stays visible after StatsGenerator has loaded 
+ DREAM3D Issue #780: Help Window can not be resized.
+ DREAM3D Issue #781: Help Window stops loading help files?
+ DREAM3D Issue #782: Combine Attribute Arrays should have an option to copy or move the data
+ DREAM3D Issue #783: Identify Sample Documentation needs example image when to to use the filter 
+ DREAM3D Issue #784: Crop Volume (Image) needs to have a cancel check in the inner cropping loop
+ DREAM3D Issue #789: Calculate the Sphericity of each feature
+ DREAM3D Issue #794: Parallelize the FindNeighborhoods filter.ÃŸ
+ Enable Tetragonal High, Tetragonal Low, Trigonal High & Trigonal Low Laue Group for Pole Figure generation
+ Fix a regression where incorrect static_cast<> would cause black pole figures.
+ Fix memory leak in the LaueOps classes when multi-threading.
+ Fixing bug where choosing the Precipitate Rolled Preset in StatsGenerator would not display a dialog box.
