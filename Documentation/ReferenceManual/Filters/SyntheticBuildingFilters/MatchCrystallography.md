## Group (Subgroup) ##
Synthetic Builder Filters (Crystallography)

## Description ##
This Filter searches for the crystal structures present and finds where matches occur in the synthetic volume. The _Initialize Synthetic Volume_ Filter must be run before this Filter will function properly, because that Filter generates the Statistics needed by this Filter. *GrainIds* are also needed and must have been generated in other Synthetic Builder Filters.
