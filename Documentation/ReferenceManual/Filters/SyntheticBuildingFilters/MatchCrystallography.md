## Group (Subgroup) ##
Synthetic Builder Filters (Crystallography)

## Description ##
This Filter iteratively either swaps out the orientation of a **Field** (selected at random) for a new orientation (sampled from the goal Orientation Distribution Function) or switches the orientations of two **Fields** (selected at random).  The switch or swap is accepted if it lowers the error of the current ODF and Misorientation Distribution Function from the goal.  This is done for a user defined number of iterations.  

## Parameters ##
| Name | Type |
|------|------|
| Maximum Number of Iterations (Swaps) | Integer |

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Segment Fields (Misorientation, C-Axis Misorientation, Scalar) (Reconstruction), Read Dx File (IO), Read Ph File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Field | FieldPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Field**| | Find Field Phases (Generic), Read Field Info File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Field | SurfaceFields |  |  | Find Surface Fields (Generic)
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Ensemble | NumFields |  |  | Find Number of Fields (Statistics) |
| Ensemble | Statistics |  |  | Generate Ensemble Statistics (Statistics), StatsGenerator Application |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Comment |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Cell | CellEulerAngles |  |
| Field | AvgQuats |  |
| Field | FieldEulerAngles |  |
| Field | Volumes |  |
