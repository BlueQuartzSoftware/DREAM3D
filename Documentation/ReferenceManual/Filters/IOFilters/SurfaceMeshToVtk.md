Write Vtk PolyData File (From SurfaceMesh) {#surfacemeshtovtk}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
IO Filters

## Description ##
This filter will create a "legacy" vtk file (.vtk) that contains the POINTS and POLYGONS, where each POLYGON is a triangle.
In addition the NODE_TYPE will be written as POINT_DATA and the GRAIN_ID will be written as CELL_DATA. There are 2 options
for this filter.

__Write Binary Vtk File__ If this option is selected then the data portions of the file will be written in Big Endian
binary format as stipulated by the VTK file format.

- __Write Conformal Mesh__ If this is ___true___ then only a single triangle will be written which will be shared
between 2 **Field** (region) ids. If this is ___false___ then 2 triangles with opposite winding will be written and each
will have a **Field** ID assigned to it.
