Read H5Ebsd File {#readh5ebsd}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
I/O Filters (Input)


## Description ##

This Filter reads from the **.h5ebsd** file that was generated with the [Import Orientation File(s) to H5Ebsd](ebsdtoh5ebsd.html) filter. The user can use the checkboxes under the _**Voxel Data**_ tab to select which specific data arrays they are interested in processing. Different pipelines may require different arrays to be read and this advanced interface allows the user to be selective in the data that is read into memory for processing. The user can select a subset of the slices if they do not wish to process the entire volume of data. The type of transformations that are recommended based on the manufacturer of the data are also listed with a checkbox that the user can check to make sure the data is transformed into the proper _Euler_ and _Spatial_ reference frame.

If the processing pipeline is going to process phase based data for crystallographic information the user should enable the reading of the _CrystalStructure_ _**Ensemble Data**_ array.
