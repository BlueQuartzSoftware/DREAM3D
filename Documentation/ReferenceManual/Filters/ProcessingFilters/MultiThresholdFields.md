Multi Threshold (Field Data) {#multithresholdfields}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Threshold)

## Description ##
This filter is similar to the [SingleThresholdFields](singlethresholdfields.html) filter but allows the user to input more than a single **Field** array. Internally the algorithm creates the output boolean arrays for each comparison that the user creates. Then all the output arrays are compared and if __any__ of the values for a specific **Field**  is __false__ then the corresponding **Field** in the final output array is marked as false. This is considered a logical 'or' operation.

  An exmaple of this filter's use would be after statistics are calculated with DREAM3D and the user wants to have DREAM3D consider **Fields** that the user considers 'critical'. The user could insert this filter and select the criteria that makes a **Field** 'critical'. For example if **Fields** that are both large and preferably oriented for slip are of interest, then one could use _Equivalent Diameter_ > X and _Schmid Factor_ > 0.45 as good criteria.
