Single Threshold (Cell Data) {#singlethresholdcells}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Threshold)

## Description ##
This filter allows the user to select a specific **Cell** array and apply a comparison operation (&lt, &gt, =) of a
 value (set by the user). The result is a new **Cell** array of Boolean values added to the pipeline. The user can set
 the name of the array that is added through the __Output Array Name__ option.
 For example if you wanted to generate a boolean array that indicated which **Cells** had an '_Image Quality_' greater
 than '_120_' then the user would select the '_Image Quality_' array from the __Input Cell Array Name__ combobox,
 set the Comparison Operator to "&gt" and set the __Value__ to 120. The user should also input a name for the created
 boolean array.


## Parameters ##

| Input Cell Array Name | String based on an array that is stored in the pipeline at the time the filter is run |
| Comparison Operator | &lt, &gt, = |
