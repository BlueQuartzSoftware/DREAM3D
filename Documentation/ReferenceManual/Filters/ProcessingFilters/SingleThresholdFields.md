Single Threshold (Field Data) {#singlethresholdfields}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Threshold)

## Description ##
This filter allows the user to select a specific **Field** array and apply a comparison operation (&lt, &gt, =) of a
 value (set by the user). The result is a new **Field** array of Boolean values added to the pipeline. The user can set
 the name of the array that is added through the __Output Array Name__ option.
 For example if you wanted to generate a boolean array that indicated which **Fields** had an '_Equivalent Diameter_' greater
 than '_10_' then the user would select the '_Equivalent Diameters_' array from the __Input Field Array Name__ combobox,
 set the Comparison Operator to "&gt" and set the __Value__ to 10. The user should also input a name for the created
 boolean array.
