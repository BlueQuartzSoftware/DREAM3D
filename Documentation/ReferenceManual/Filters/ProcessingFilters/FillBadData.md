Fill Bad Data {#fillbaddata}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Processing Filters (Cleanup)

## Description ##
This Filter removes small "*noise*" in the data, but keeps larger regions that are possibly features, e.g., pores or defects.
This Filter collects the *bad* **Cells** (*GrainId = 0*) and runs the _erode_ operation from the [Erode/Dilate Bad Data Filter](OpenCloseBadData.html "") until none remain. However, contiguous groups of *bad* **Cells** that have at least as many **Cells** as the minimum defect size enter by the user will not be *eroded*.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type |
|------|------|
| Minimum Allowed Defect Size | Integer |

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Segment Fields (Misorientation, C-Axis Misorientation, Scalar) (Reconstruction), Read Dx File (IO), Read Ph File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
