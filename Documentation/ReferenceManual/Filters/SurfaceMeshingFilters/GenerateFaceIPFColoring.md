Generate Face IPF Coloring {#generatefaceipfcoloring}
======================

## Group (Subgroup) ##
SurfaceMesh

## Description ##

This filter generates a per triangle pair of colors based on the Inverse Pole Figure (IPF) color triangle for the crystal structure of the grain. Each face has 2 colors because each face is the boundary between 2 Grains or **Fields**. The reference direction used for the IPF color generation is the Normal of the face.

_The user will need to calculate the Face Normals before this filter is run._

After running this filter visualizing the grains should result in something like the following image.
