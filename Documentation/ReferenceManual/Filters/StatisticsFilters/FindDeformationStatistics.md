Find Deformation Statistics {#finddeformationstatistics}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics Filters (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
This Filter looks for correlations between various local deformation metrics (i.e. Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) of Grain Reference Misorientation (GRM)) and distance from a **Field** boundary.  The filter builds histograms of these metrics as a function of distance from a **Field** boundary and writes them to a user specified output file.  

Note: this filter was developed for analyzing microtension specimens that had been deformed and then serial-sectioned at AFRL.

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Segment Fields (Misorientation, C-Axis Misorientation, Scalar) (Reconstruction), Read Dx File (IO), Read Ph File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |

| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |
