Find Field Average C-Axes {#findavgcaxes}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics Filters (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
This Filter determines the average c-axis location of each **Field** by the following algorithm:

1. Gather all **Cells** that belong to the **Field**
2. Determine the location of the c-axis in the sample *reference frame* for the rotated quaternions for all **Cells**.

3.  average the locations and store as the average for the **Field**.

Note: This filter will only work properly for *Hexagonal* materials.  The filter does not apply any symmetry operators because there is only one c-axis (<001>) in *Hexagonal* materials and thus all symmetry operators will leave the c-axis in the same position in the sample *reference frame*.  However, in *Cubic* materials, for example, the {100} family of directions are all equivalent and the <001> direction will change location in the sample *reference frame* when symmetry operators are applied.
