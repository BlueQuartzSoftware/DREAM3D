Find Field Neighbor Misorientations {#findmisorientations}
==========

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics Filters (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
This Filter determines, for each **Field**, the misorientations with the **Fields** that are in contact with it.  The misorientations are stored as a list (for each **Field**) of angles.  The axis of the misorientation is not stored by this filter.

## Parameters ##

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Field | NeighborLists | List of the contiguous neighboring **Fields** for a given **Field** |  |
| Field | AvgQuats | Five (5) values (floats) defining the average orientation of the **Field** in quaternion representation | Filter will calculate average quaternions for **Fields** if not already calculated. |
| Field | FieldPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Field** | Filter will determine **Field** phases if not previously determined |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. |
