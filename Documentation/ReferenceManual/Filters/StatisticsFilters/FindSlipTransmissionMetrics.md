Find Neighbor Slip Transmission Metrics {#findsliptransmissionmetrics}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics Filters (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
This filter calculates a suite of *Slip Transmission Metrics* that are related to the alignment of slip directions and planes across **Field** boundaries.  Equations for the metrics (F1, F1spt, F7 and mPrime) can be found in [1,2].  The algorithm for calculation of these metrics is as follows:

1. Get the average orientation of the **Field**.
2. Get the **Field**'s list of neighboring **Fields**.
3. Get the average orientation of each neighboring **Field**.
4. Calculate metrics given by equations in [1,2].
5. Store metrics in lists for the **Field**.
6. Repeat for all **Fields**.

Note: the transmission metrics are calculated using the average orientations for neighboring **Fields** and not the local orientation near the boundary.

Note: the metrics are calculated twice (i.e. when **Field** 1 has neighbor **Field** 2 and when **Field** 2 has neighbor **Field 1) because the direction across the boundary between the **Fields** affects the value of the metric.

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Field | NeighborLists | List of the contiguous neighboring **Fields** for a given **Field** |  | Find Field Neighbors (Statistics) |
| Field | FieldPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Field**| | Find Field Phases (Generic), Read Field Info File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Field | AvgQuats | Five (5) values (floats) defining the average orientation of the **Field** in quaternion representation | Filter will calculate average quaternions for **Fields** if not already calculated. | Find Field Average Orientations (Statistics) |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |
