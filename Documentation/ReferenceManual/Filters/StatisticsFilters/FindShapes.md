Find Field Shapes {#findshapes}

Statistics Filters (Morphological)

## Description ##
 The user has the option of entering a distribution choice: Beta, LogNormal or Power.
  The 3-D moment invariants of second order are three numbers, represented by the symbols 0≤Ωi≤  1 (i = 1, 2, 3), which are computed starting
from the shape of an object. The moment invariants are invariant with respect to either similarity
or affine coordinate transformations, which renders them particularly useful as quantitative shape
descriptors that are independent of the reference frame used to represent the object(s).
Omega1 and Omega2 are related to aspect ratios, while Omega3 is useful for shape characterization. Details of the Omega3 shape descriptors are given in the Sources that include Tables of all three Omega expressions for basic geometrical shapes.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type |
|------|------|
| Distribution Type | Choices |

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. |
| Field | Centroids | X, Y, Z coordinates (floats) of **Field** center of mass | Filter will calculate **Field** centroids if not previously calculated |
| Field | Volumes | Volume (float) in um^3 of the **Field**. | Filter will calculate volume of each **Field** if not already calculated |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Field | AspectRatios |  |  |
| Field | AxisEulerAngles |  |  |
| Field | AxisLengths |  |  |
