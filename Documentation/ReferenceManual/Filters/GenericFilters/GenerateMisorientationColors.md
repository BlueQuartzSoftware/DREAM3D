Generate Misorientation Colors {#generatemisorientationcolors}
========

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Misc)

## Description ##
This filter will generate colors based on the method developed by C. Schuh and S. Patala for Cubic, Hexagonal, Tetragonal, or Orthorhombic Crystal Structures (currently only cubic high is working)[1]. Orientations are colored by disorientation relative to a reference orientation. The user can enter a reference orientation which is relative to the sample reference frame. The default reference orientation is the sample frame (misorientation from sample frame: 0 degrees about [001]). 

The user is required to run a filter that will determine if a voxel should have it's color calculated by generating the _GoodVoxels_ array or an equivalent **boolean** array. Typically the **MultiThreshold Cells** or **Single Threshold Cells** filter is run _before_ this filter with an output array set to _GoodVoxels_.

### Color Output Notes ###

Since the coloring scheme uses all possibly colors in the spectrum easily marking voxels in an image that should NOT have been colored is impossible versus a method like the IPF coloring scheme where black can be used to mark these "bad" voxels or non-indexed voxels in the case of an EBSD scan.

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description  | Filters Known to Create Data |
|------|--------------|------------|-----|
| Cell | CellQuats |  These are the orientations used to determine the colors | Find Cell Quaternions |
| Cell | CellPhases |  These are used to determine which ensemble the **Cell** belongs to | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |  
| Cell | GoodVoxels | This is the boolean array that determines if a voxel will have its IPF Color generated or not. | [MultiThreshold Cells](multithresholdcells.html), [Single Threshold Cells](singlethresholdcells.html) |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures |  These are the symmetries of the ensembles, which dictate orientation operations and which color palatte is used | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |
