Find Cell Quaternions {#findcellquats}
=======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Crystallography)

## Description ##

This filter determines the _quaternions_ for each **Cell**, given the _Euler_ angles for the **Cell**. 
The _quaternions_ calculated are rotated such that they all lie within the *Fundamental Zone (FZ)* nearest to the origin of orientation space for the crystal structure of the **Cell**'s phase.
The FZ is the region of orientation space that contains general positions on which the symmetry operations of the structure cannot operate to generate other positions within the region that are symmetrically equivalent. 
 


## Parameters ##
None

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | CellEulerAngles | Three (3) angles (floats) defining the orientation of the **Cell** in Bunge convention (Z-X-Z) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Match Crystallography (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Cell | CellPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Cell** | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Array Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| Cell | Quats | Five (5) values (floats) that specify the orientation of the **Cell** in quaternion representation | The first value is a dummy value, so each **Cell** has quat = {dummy, q1, q2, q3, q4} - where q1, q2, and q3 contain the axis information and q4 contains the angle information of the quaternion |
