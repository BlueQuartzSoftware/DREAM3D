Renumber Fields {#renumbergrains}
========

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Memory/Management)

## Description ##
This filter will renumber the GrainIds array to make it contiguous from *0* to *N-1*.  This is necessary if some prior filter has removed a **Field** for some reason and it is desired to have a continuous number of the **Fields**.  The filter cues off a boolean **Field** array called *Active* to know whether a given **Field** is in existance.  The **Field** array map is rescaled to the number of "active" **Fields** and the **Cell** array called *GrainIds* is updated to reflect the new numbers of the **Fields** after the "inactive" **Fields** are removed.
 
## Parameters ##
 None

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Segment Fields (Misorientation, C-Axis Misorientation, Scalar) (Reconstruction), Read Dx File (IO), Read Ph File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) 
| Field | Active | This is a boolean array that states *true* if the **Field** exists and states *false* if the **Field** does not exist | This array must be present for this filter to run.  The values cannot be determined by this filter. | Minimum Size Filter (Processing), Minimum Number of Neighbors Filter (Processing), Crop Volume (Sampling) |
