Find Bounding Box Fields {#findboundingboxgrains}
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Generic Filters (Spatial)

## Description ##
This filter determines which **Fields** are _biased_ by the outer surfaces of the sample. Larger **Fields** are more likely to intersect the outer surfaces and thus it is not sufficient to only note which **Fields** touch the outer surfaces of the sample.
Denoting which **Fields** are biased is important so that they may be excluded from any statistical analyses. 
The algorithm for determining whether a **Field** is _biased_ is as follows: 

1. The _centroids_ of all **Fields** are calculated
2. All **Fields** are tested to determine if they touch an outer surface of the sample
3. The largest box is found that does not include any of the _centroids_ of **Fields** that intersect an outer surface of the sample
4. Each **Field**'s _centroid_ is checked to see whether it lies within the box.  

*If a **Field**'s _centroid_ lies within the box, then the **Field** is said to be _unbiased_, and if it lies outside the box, then the **Field** is said to be _biased_.* 

By definition of the box, no **Field** that intersects an outer surface of the sample can be considered _unbiased_, but it should be noted that **Fields** that do not intersect the outer surfaces may still be considered _biased_ 
This algorithm works to determine the biased **Fields** because all **Fields** have one (and only one) centroid, no matter their size. Generally, this method will deem more small **Fields** biased than the set of **Fields** that just intersect the outer surfaces - and this corrects for the increased likelihood that larger **Fields** will touch an outer surface.
