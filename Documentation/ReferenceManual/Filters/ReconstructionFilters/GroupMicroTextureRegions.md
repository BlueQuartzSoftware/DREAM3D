Identify MicroTexture (C-Axis Misorientation) {#groupmicrotextureregions}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Reconstruction Filters (Grouping)

## Description ##
This Filter groups neighboring **Fields** that have c-axes aligned within a user defined tolerance.  The algorithm for grouping the **Fields** is analogous to the algorithm for segmenting the **Fields** - only the average orientation of the **Fields** are used instead of the orientations of the individual **Cells** and the criterion for grouping only considers the alignment of the c-axes.  The user can specify a tolerance for how closely aligned the c-axes must be for neighbor **Fields** to be grouped.

NOTE: This filter is intended for use with *Heaxgonal* materials.  While the c-axis is actually just referring to the <001> direction and thus will operate on any symmetry, the utility of grouping by <001> alignment is likely only important/useful in materials with anisotropy in that direction (like materials with *Hexagonal* symmetry). 


## Parameters ##

| Name | Type |
|------|------|
| C-Axis Alignment Tolerance | Double |

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. |
| Field | FieldPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Field** | Filter will determine **Field** phases if not previously determined |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. |
| Field | AvgQuats | Five (5) values (floats) defining the average orientation of the **Field** in quaternion representation | Filter will calculate average quaternions for **Fields** if not already calculated. |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Field | Active | Boolean value specifying if the **Field** is still in the sample (1 if the **Field** is in the sample and 0 if it is not) | At the end of the filter, all **Fields** will be "Active" as the "Inactive" **Fields** will have been removed.  |
