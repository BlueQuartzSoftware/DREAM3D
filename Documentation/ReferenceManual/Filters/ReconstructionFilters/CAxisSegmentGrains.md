Segment Fields (C-Axis Misorientation) {#caxissegmentgrains}
======

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Reconstruction Filters (Segmentation)

## Description ##
The _c-axis misorientation_ refers to the angle between the <001> directions (c-axis in the hexagonal system) that is present between neighboring __Cells__. This filter searches for and identifies those __Cells__ that satisfy the tolerance angle (in degrees) entered by the user. 

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Comment |
|------|------|-----|
| C-Axis Misorientation Tolerance | Double | Value is in degrees |

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | CellPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Cell** | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Cell | GoodVoxels | Boolean values used to define "regions" to be aligned | Values are not required to be based on "good" or "bad" data, rather must only correspond to some identified "regions"  | Single Threshold (Cell Data) (Processing), Multi Threshold (Cell Data) (Processing) |
| Cell | Quats | Five (5) values (floats) that specify the orientation of the **Cell** in quaternion representation | Filter will calculate the quaternion for each **Cell** if it is not already calculated. | Find Cell Quaternions (Generic) |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. |  |
| Field | Active | Boolean value specifying if the **Field** is still in the sample (1 if the **Field** is in the sample and 0 if it is not) | At the end of the filter, all **Fields** will be "Active" as the "Inactive" **Fields** will have been removed.  |
