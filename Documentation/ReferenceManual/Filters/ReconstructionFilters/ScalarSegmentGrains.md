## Group (Subgroup) ##
Reconstruction Filters (Segmentation)

## Description ##
This filter groups together **Cells** that differ in some user defined scalar value by less than a user defined tolerance.  For example, if the user selected array was an 8bit image array, then the array would consist of integer values between *0* and *255*.  If the user then set a tolerance vlaue of 10, then the filter would identify all sets of contiguous **Cells** that have *grayscale* values with *10* of each other.
