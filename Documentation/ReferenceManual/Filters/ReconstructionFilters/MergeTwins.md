Merge Twins {#mergetwins}

## Group (Subgroup) ##
Reconstruction Filters (Grouping)

## Description ##
This Filter groups neighboring **Fields** that are in a twin relationship with each other (currently only fcc Σ3 twins).  The algorithm for grouping the **Fields** is analogous to the algorithm for segmenting the **Fields** - only the average orientation of the **Fields** are used instead of the orientations of the individual **Cells**.  The user can specify a tolerance on both the *axis* and the *angle* that defines the twin relationship (i.e. a tolerance of 1 degree for both tolerances would allow the neighboring **Fields** to be grouped if their misorientation was between 59-61 degrees about an axis within 1 degree of <111>, since the Σ3 twin relationship is 60 degrees about <111>).


## Parameters ##

| Name | Type |

| Axis Tolerance | Double |
| Angle Tolerance | Double |

## Required DataContainers ##
Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment | Filters Known to Create Data
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| Cell | GrainIds | Ids (ints) that specify to which **Field** each **Cell** belongs. | Values should be present from segmentation of experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Segment Fields (Misorientation, C-Axis Misorientation, Scalar) (Reconstruction), Read Dx File (IO), Read Ph File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Field | FieldPhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Field**| | Find Field Phases (Generic), Read Field Info File (IO), Pack Primary Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Insert Precipitate Phases (SyntheticBuilding), Establish Matrix Phase (SyntheticBuilding) |
| Field | AvgQuats | Five (5) values (floats) defining the average orientation of the **Field** in quaternion representation | Filter will calculate average quaternions for **Fields** if not already calculated. | Find Field Average Orientations (Statistics) |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. | Read H5Ebsd File (IO), Read Ensemble Info File (IO), Initialize Synthetic Volume (SyntheticBuilding) |

## Created Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Field | Active | Boolean value specifying if the **Field** is still in the sample (1 if the **Field** is in the sample and 0 if it is not) | At the end of the filter, all **Fields** will be "Active" as the "Inactive" **Fields** will have been removed.  |
