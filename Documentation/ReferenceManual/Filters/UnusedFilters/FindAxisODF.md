Find Field Axis ODF {#findaxisodf}
======


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Statistics Filters (Morphological)



## Description ##
The ODF is defined as the volume fraction of **Fields** with a certain orientation vector.
The orientation vector is normally identified using three _Euler_ angles which are used to describe the transition from the _sample_â€™s reference frame into the _crystallographic_ reference frame of each individual **Field** of the polycrystal. One thus ends up with a large set of different _Euler_ angles, the distribution of which is described by the ODF.
This Filter searches and identifies the ODF axis of the volume fraction of **Fields**.
