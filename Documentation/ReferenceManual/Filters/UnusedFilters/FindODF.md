Find ODF {#findodf}
======


## Group (Subgroup) ##
Statistics Filters (Crystallographic)

## Description ##
 The Filter finds the _Orientation Distribution Function _(ODF).

The ODF is defined as the volume fraction of **Features** with a certain orientation vector.
The orientation vector is normally identified using three _Euler_ angles which are used to describe the transition from the _sample_â€™s reference frame into the _crystallographic_ reference frame of each individual **Feature** of the polycrystal. One thus ends up with a large set of different _Euler_ angles, the distribution of which is described by the ODF.
The full 3D representation of crystallographic texture is given by the _Orientation Distribution Function_ (ODF). Subsequently, all pole figures can be derived from the ODF.

 This site (Prof. Tony Rollett, CMU) contains source material that is very helpful in explaining Texture and the related concepts, including ODF._

Voxel

## Required Arrays ##

| Type | Default Name | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Feature | FeatureEulerAngles | Three (3) angles (floats) defining the orientation of each **Feature** in Bunge convention (Z-X-Z) | Filter will calculate average Euler angles for each **Feature** if not already calculated. |
| Feature | FeaturePhases | Phase Id (int) specifying the phase of the **Feature** | Filter will determine **Feature** phases if not previously determined |
| Feature | Volumes | Volume (float) in um^3 of the **Feature**. | Filter will calculate the volume of each **Feature** if not already calculated |
| Feature | SurfaceFeatures | Boolean flag of 1 if **Feature** touches an outer surface or of 0 if it does not | Filter will determine if **Features** intersect an outer surface if not already determined |
| Ensemble | CrystalStructures | Enumeration (int) specifying the crystal structure of each Ensemble/phase (Hexagonal=0, Cubic=1, Orthorhombic=2) | Values should be present from experimental data or synthetic generation and cannot be determined by this filter. Not having these values will result in the filter to fail/not execute. |
