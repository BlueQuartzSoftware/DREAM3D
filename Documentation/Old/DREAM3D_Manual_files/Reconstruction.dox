@section features Features Overview

@li Uses HDF5 Based input files
@li Allows user to select full volume or subvolume to reconstruct
@li Allows user to select which output files to write
@li User can select from many different options
@li Several types of slice registration available
@li Save all input settings to a simple text file for later loading or sharing
with others.
@li Output files are written in VTK file format or HDF5 which can be viewed in
ParaView with a custom plugin

@section inputparamerters Determining Input Parameters

One of the most important input parameters is the <b>Min. Image Quality</b> which
helps determines the actual grains versus the noise of the background. For our
example we used ParaView to view the ImageQuality data from an TSL OIM scan .ang
data file. Displaying the raw data shows the following image with an arbitrary
coloring scheme.

The object is to find a minimum value where every piece of data below the value
is considered noise and values above are considered good data. Experimentation
with your data is the only way to reveal what this minimum value is. For our
example data set we used a value of 600 and the resulting thresholded image is
shown below.

@section settingsfile Using a Settings File

  The main AIMRepresentation GUI Reconstruction tab has an available button to
allow the user to save all the settings on the Reconstruction Tab. These settings
are saved to a simple text file with the following format:

@code
[Reconstruction]
OutputDir=/tmp
H5InputFile=/Users/Shared/Data/Ang_Data/12_strain/12_strain.h5ang
ZStartIndex=10074
ZEndIndex=10175
MergeTwins=false
MergeColonies=false
FillinSample=false
AlreadyFormed=false
MinAllowedGrainSize=8
MinConfidence=0.1
BinStepSize=1
DownSampleFactor=1
MinImageQuality=50
MisOrientationTolerance=5
CrystalStructure=0
AlignMeth=0
DisorientationVizFile=true
ImageQualityVizFile=true
IPFVizFile=true
SchmidFactorVizFile=true
VisualizationVizFile=true
DownSampledVizFile=true
HDF5GrainFile=true
@endcode

Some of the values have special values:\n
<b>CrystalStructure</b>
@li 0 = Hexagonal
@li 1 = Cubic

<b>AlignMeth</b>\n
@li Outer Boundary
@li Misorientation
@li Mutual Information

The following values are considered boolean values and either have a "false"
or "true" value.\n

@li MergeTwins
@li MergeColonies
@li FillinSample
@li AlreadyFormed
@li DisorientationVizFile
@li ImageQualityVizFile
@li IPFVizFile
@li SchmidFactorVizFile
@li VisualizationVizFile
@li DownSampledVizFile
@li HDF5GrainFile



@section rec_details Reconstruction Tab
1.  OIM HDF5 File  This is the name and location of the .h5ang file you wish to reconstruct
@li a.  The minimum and maximum slice numbers will be automatically displayed with the z resolution or spacing

2.  Start Slice and End Slice  This defines the range of sections you wish to reconstruct
@li a.  Like you can choose to not import the entire dataset, you can choose to not reconstruct everything you imported


3.  Options  These are all the options that can be set to control the reconstruction
@li a.  Merge Colonies  this is an option that will reconstruct prior beta grains in an alpha-beta titanium microstructure.  It will first identify alpha colonies and then compare neighboring colonies to group colonies form the same prior beta grain
@li b.  Grains Formed  this is an option to read in a previously reconstructed volume in which the grain ids have already been assigned.  Currently it reads the output data from Yoons Abaqus analysis and from the FFT code at CMU.  I am working to change the format the data is read in and create a standard.
@li c.  Merge Twins  this is an option similar to Mere Colonies, but when comparing neighboring grains to be merged it uses misorientations linked to twins not colonies from the same beta grain
@li d.  Cryst. Struct.  this is the crystal structure (i.e. Cubic, Hexagonal, Orthorhombic) of the material being reconstructed.  This defines what symmetry operators are used during the misorientation calculations.  Note that right now only one crystal structure can be selected at a time, but we are working to allow crystal structures to be assigned to multiple phases that can be present
@li e.  Alignment Method  this allows the user to choose the method used to align neighboring sections.  Outer Boundary simply tries to align the area identified as sample on each section.  Minimum Disorientation moves the sections until there is a minimum value of disorientation between all voxels in one section and voxel directly above it in the next section.  Mutual information segments each section independently and then performs a mutual information analysis on the grain ids.
@li f.  Ang Orientation  this defines the origin of the ang file.
@li g.  Min Grain Size  this a clean-up filter that can be set to merge grains below a defined size after grains have been formed.  Currently the grains are reset to unassigned and then the region is filled in by a local grain growth algorithm
@li h.  Disorient. Tol.  this is the orientation difference tolerance allowed between neighboring regions before they are declared different grains
@li i.  Min. Image Quality  this is a threshold value that is used to define the outer border of the sample and terminate grain formation during segmentation
@li j.  Min. Confidence Index  this is threshold used the same as Min. Image Quaity
@li k.  Down-sample Res.  this a factor used to down-sample the 3D volume if desired.  If the value is set to 1, then nothing happens, but any other value will scale the resolution by that value.  A new grid is created and laid over the original data grid.
@li l.  Bin Step Size  this is the step size used in correlating statistical descriptors to grain size.  The value is set in microns, so for example, if the maximum grain size is 50 microns, a value of 5 would create 10 size bins in which grains would be segregated to create shape, no. of neighbors, etc. distributions as a function of grain size.

4.  Output Directory  location that all output files will be written to.

5.  Optional Output Files  these are all visualization files that can be created.
@li a.  Reconstruction Visualization  - this file contains grain ids and Euclidean distance to grain boundaries
@li b.  Reconstruction IPF Visualization  - this file contains grain ids and Inverse Pole Figure colors
@li c.  Reconstruction Disorientation Visualization  - this file contains grain ids and Kernel Average Misorientations and Grain Average Misorientations
@li d.  Reconstruction ImageQuality Visualization  - this file contains grain ids and Image Qualities
@li e.  Reconstruction SchmidFactor Visualization  - this file contains grain ids and Schmid Factors
@li f.  Reconstruction DownSampled Visualization  - this file contains grain ids for the down-sampled volume
@li g.  Reconstruction Grains  - this file contains each grain with properly defined voxels and their neighbor connectivities
