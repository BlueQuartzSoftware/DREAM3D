@section gg_details User Interface Parameters

1.  HDF5 Stats File  name and location of the input stats file that can be generated
from the reconstruction tab or the stats generator module.

2.  Output Directory  location where all the output files will be written

3.  Options
@li a.  Structure Already Formed  this is similar to the option in the reconstruction
tab.  If a volume has already been created, this option will read the .vtk file
with grain ids.  It enters the synthetic builder right before the orientation assignment
and matching, so it does not need any orientation information, just the structural
information.
@li b.  Space Filling Error Weight  this the weight to be applied to the criterion
of maximizing space filling during grain placement.
@li c.  Size Distribution Error Weight  this is the weight to be applied to matching
the size distribution during grain placement.
@li d.  Neighborhood Error Weight  this is the weight to be applied to matching
the local neighborhoods during grain placement
@li e.  Number of Grains  this is the target desired number of grains.  The final
number may not be this exact value, but should be close.  This defines the size of
the volume generated, which is not defined by the user.
@li f.  X, Y, Z Spacing  this is the resolution of the voxels in the generated
volume.  The user should be aware of the size distribution when selecting this
value and the number of grains.  If attention is not paid to these values in conjunction,
crashes do to memory overload are possible.
@li g.  Shape Class  this is the type of object being placed during grain placement.
The user can choose ellipsoids, superellipsoids or truncated octahedra.  Ellipsoids
do not need the omega3 value, but the other two options require omega3 to be defined.
@li h.  Crystal Structure  this is the crystal structure of the material (i.e.
cubic or hexagonal) and is used during the misorientation calculations and orientation
matching portion of the builder.
@li i.  Precipitate Structure  this is an option to place precipitates in the
volume on either boundaries or randomly throughout the structure.  Currently this
option is not useable because neither the reconstruction tab or the stats generator
produce statistics for precipitates.
@li j.  Volume Fraction Precipitates  this defines the amount of precipitates to
be placed in the structure

4.  Load/Save Preset  this allows the user to save input setting or load previously
saved input setting
