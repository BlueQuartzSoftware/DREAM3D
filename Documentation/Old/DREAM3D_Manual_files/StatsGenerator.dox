@section sg_gui User Interface - Main Window
0. Phase Selection - The user can use the "+" button to add another phase to the
StatsGenerator document. The user can select the crystal structure and Phase Fraction
of the new phase using the dialog that pops up.

1.  Size Distribution Tab
@li a.  <b>Mu</b>  this is the average value of the lognormal grain size distribution
@li b.  <b>Sigma</b> this is the standard deviation of the lognormal grain size distribution
@li c.  <b>Sigma Cut Off Value</b>  this allows the user to truncate the distribution
to remove very large grains
@li d.  <b>Bin Step Size</b> this is the size of bin to use in segregating the grains
into size classes for correlating other statistics to grain size. Note that the
number of bins that will be created is displayed in the
bottom left corner
@li e.  <b>Create Default Data</b>  this locks in the values you have entered and populates
the other tabs with default values.

2.  Omega 3 Tab
@li a.  Bin  this column is calculated from the size distribution and cannot be changed.
@li b.  Alpha  this is the alpha parameter of a Beta distribution.  Omega 3 is normalized and can only be between 0 and 1, so the Beta distribution is a good fit
@li c.  Beta  this is the beta parameter of the Beta distribution.
@li d.  Color  this allows the user to change colors of the curves for image creation or easier identification during stats generation

3.  Shape Distributions Tab (there are 3 aspect ratio combinations)
@li a.  Bin  this column is calculated from the size distribution and cannot be changed.
@li b.  Alpha  this is the alpha parameter of a Beta distribution.  B/A, C/A and C/B are all normalized and can only be between 0 and 1, so the Beta distribution is a good fit
@li c.  Beta  this is the beta parameter of the Beta distribution.
@li d.  Color  this allows the user to change colors of the curves for image creation or easier identification during stats generation

4.  Neighbor Distributions Tab
@li a.  Bin  this column is calculated from the size distribution and cannot be changed.
@li b.  Alpha  this is the alpha parameter of a Power Law distribution.
@li c.  K  this is the exponent of a Power Law Distribution
@li d.  Beta  this is the beta parameter of a Power Law distribution.
@li e.  Color  this allows the user to change colors of the curves for image creation or easier identification during stats generation

5.  ODF Tab
@li a.  Texture  these are a list of common FCC textures.
@li b.  Weight  this is the weight in Times Random to be assigned to the texture listed
@li c.  Sigma  this is the spread to use in blurring out the texture chosen.
@li d.  Calculate ODF  this builds the ODF and then creates pole figures for the user to inspect.
@li e.  MDF  this sub-tab will display the baseline MDF for the generated ODF, but is not currently finished.

@section sg_dev_notes StatsGenerator Developer Notes
This section contains some notes during the development of the StatsGenerator application.

@subsection sg_dev_layout QtWidget Heirarchy
The StatsGenerator application was written using the Qt framework from Nokia, which
is a cross platform GUI application framework.

The top level widget is a QMainWindow with the class name <b>StatsGeneratorUI</b>.
This class contains a single <b>SGWidget</b> which is a QWidget derived class that
contains all the subwidgets for a given phase. The user can elect to add multiple
phases to the statistics at which point for each additional phase an additional
SGWidget will be added. Within each SGWidget are a number of tabs which contain
various plotting or user input fields. Some of those tabs have one or more <b>StatsGenPlotWidget</b>
where the various distribution curves are plotted for things like Omega3, Neighbors
and the various Shape distributions. Another tab type is the SGODFWidget and SGAxisODFWidget
which contain the user interface elements to generate ODF, Axis ODF and MDF plots.
